<p>In this transcription a black dotted underline indicates a hyperlink
to a page, illustration or footnote; hyperlinks are also marked by aqua
highlighting when the mouse pointer hovers over them. A red dashed
underline indicates the presence of a comment that can be revealed by
hovering the mouse pointer over the underlined text. Page numbers are
shown in the right margin.</p>

<p>The text contains uncommon typographic characters that will not
necessarily display correctly with all browsers. If some of the
characters look abnormal, first ensure that your browser’s ‘character
encoding’ is set to Unicode (UTF-8). You might also need to change the
browser’s default font to one of the less common fonts such as Arial
Unicode MS, DejaVu, FreeSerif, or Segoe UI Symbol.</p>

<p>The text contains many numeric fractions, some of which are
indistinct and the accuracy of their transcription cannot be
guaranteed.</p>

<p><b>Errors and inconsistencies:</b><br />
Punctuation anomalies have been corrected silently (e.g. missing
periods, commas and semicolons, incorrect or missing quotation marks,
unpaired parentheses).</p>

<p>Unambiguous typographic errors have been corrected silently in the
body of the text, but are <a href="#Typographic_corrections">listed</a>
at the end of the transcription.</p>

<p>Inconsistent spellings such as those below have not been altered:<br />
<span class="ml2em">chrystals/crystals</span><br />
<span class="ml2em">chrystallized/crystallized</span><br />
<span class="ml2em">table-spoonful/tablespoonful</span><br />
<span class="ml2em">tea-spoonful/teaspoonful</span><br />
<span class="ml2em">casters/castors</span>.</p>

<p>Archaic spellings have not been altered, e.g. River Platte, drouth
(drought), maleable, inclosed.</p>

<p>Several redundant duplications of the words ‘the’ and ‘to’ have been
deleted.</p>

<p>An omitted word (‘way’) has been inserted as [way], and several
missing degree symbols have been inserted silently.</p>

<p>Index entries are not in strict alphabetic sequence.</p>

<p>Headings and captions do not have consistent styles (font,
punctuation).</p>

<p>A brief Table of Contents has been added by the transcriber to
assist readers.</p>

<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>It is surprising how many large enterprises and fortunes
depend upon some few simple trade secrets the knowledge
of which has baffled competition and crushed all rivalry.
The jealous care with which special information in trade and
manufacture is guarded frequently renders it a monumental
task to procure a single receipt or formula. Some idea,
then, may be formed of the vast amount of labor and expense
necessary to compile a work of this character. Books
of recipes are quite numerous, but to the average person the
good they contain is too often buried beneath a mass of
wordy rubbish. In the preparation of this work the object
has been to present all the best as well as the latest practical
receipts, prescriptions, and trade secrets. Over a quarter
of a million pages of patent-​office reports, encyclopedias,
trade journals, receipt books, and other special publications
have been carefully scrutinized. To the knowledge obtained
from them we include the original matter procured from
tradesmen, chemists, and the published works and private
practice of some of the most eminent physicians both in this
country and Europe, a greater portion of which has never
before appeared in print; all of which has been carefully
tested where any doubt existed. It will be found that few,
if any, misleading directions have been given. The prescriptions
have been reproduced, after careful thought, in the
form in which they were originally written. In having them
filled patronize only honest and capable druggists. In testing
the recipes follow the directions with rigid care, and
practice on a small quantity of the article until you get it
right. Realizing that perfection in anything has never been
attained, yet we believe that the work contains more really
practical information for use by the masses in every-​day life
than any similar publication.</p>

<h3>Gelatine Copying Pad.</h3>

<p class="subhd">[HEKTOGRAPH.]</p>

<p>By this process a letter, postal card, drawing, or other manuscript
can be duplicated from sixty to one hundred times from one original.
Reproductions from the copying pad are now admitted in the mails as
third-​class matter, i.&nbsp;e., one cent for every two ounces or fraction
thereof. A soft, gelatinous composition, similar to that used in making
printers’ rollers, is made and poured into shallow pans of the required
size. The pans should be made of stout zinc one-half inch deep on the
inside, with a lid or cover. The length and breadth of the pans is
determined by the class of copying to be done. Always make the pan
slightly larger than the paper used. The three sizes given below will
answer most purposes:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Postal card size</span><span class="amt">4×6</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;inches.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Full letter size</span><span class="amt">9×12</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;inches.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The composition is made as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="scripr"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Good glue</span><span class="amt">4</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounces av.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="scripr"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Glycerine</span><span class="amt">16</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounces av.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="scripr"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Water</span><span class="amt">8</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;fluid ounces.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Break up the glue and soak in the water for a few hours, then heat
by water-bath until melted. Next add the glycerine and heat together
for some time to evaporate part of the water, and then strain into the
pan, which should be placed perfectly level and filled about two-thirds
full; skim with a card to free from bubbles, and set away to cool. An
improvement consists in adding one ounce of carbonate of barium to
the fluid while warm. The composition should be made somewhat
softer for winter use than for summer, which can be done by adding a
little larger proportion of glycerine. Another way to make the composition
is to soak over night in cold water best gelatine or glue 1 part,
and the excess of water poured off. The glue is then warmed in a water-bath
with the addition of from 10 to 12 parts of glycerine, to which may<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
be added 4 to 6 parts of finely ground heavy spar, and one part dextrine
thoroughly mixed by constant stirring. (In summer less glycerine.)</p>

<p>The letter or sketch to be duplicated is written on a sheet of paper
with ink specially prepared for the purpose (see <a href="#Inks">inks</a>). For the original
it is best to use smooth, well-​sized writing paper, allowing the ink to
dry without using a blotter. After writing the original place it face
downward on the pad, and rub it gently with the hand to insure contact
at every point. Let it remain from two to six minutes, according to the
number of copies you wish to print. In cold weather it should be left
longer, as it requires more time for the composition to absorb the ink.
Remove the original carefully, and a reversed impression will be observed
on the pad. To take off copies lay dry sheets of paper on the
reversed impression, press gently, and remove quickly.</p>

<p>When you have taken all the copies you require wash the ink from
the surface <i>at once</i> with a sponge and plenty of lukewarm water; never
use hot water. The surface of the composition will allow considerable
rubbing without fear of tearing it, if not done roughly and carelessly.
Be sure your sponge is free from sand and grit, and also avoid scratching
with the finger nails. Always wash the surface with a sponge before
using, and dry with a newspaper. In cold weather if the composition
feels chilled it will not absorb the ink properly, and the copies will be
faint unless it be carefully warmed to a moderate temperature. Attention
to these details will produce the most gratifying results.</p>


<h3>Foliotypes.</h3>

<p>Horace M. Engle, Esq., of Marietta, Pa., has devised a method of
taking leaf-prints of marked beauty, which he terms “foliotypes,”
some specimens of which he sent to Dr. Gray, the eminent botanist, who
pronounced the process a new way, and advised him to send an account
of it to the <i>Botanical Gazette</i>, which he generously did. We have employed
the method according to the explanation there given (which we
reprint in full) with the most delightful results, having secured prints
of some beautiful leaves which are faithful to nature in color and outline,
with all their delicate tracery: “The method is of actual usefulness
to the botanist, as well as a refining recreation for others who love
Nature ‘on general principles.’ For illustrating monographs and similar
papers, where the number is too limited to warrant an expensive
lithograph; for identifying a rare specimen, or as an adjunct to an
herbarium, combining portability, unalterability, and beauty withal the
method seems particularly fitted. But aside from this others may find a
delightful and instructive recreation in taking prints of the entire flora
of the old farm, the trees of a certain grove, the native annuals of a
county, the ferns of a State, or any other special field that seems most
inviting. Such copies may be taken in a blank book suited to the purpose,
or, better, take them on single sheets of uniform size, as in this<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
way imperfect copies may be thrown out, and when the work is completed
they may be named, classified, and bound, making a volume of
real value and worthy of just pride.</p>

<p>“The process consists in using the leaf for producing an impression as
a printer uses type, the ink being green, and the pressure applied either
by hand or with a press. There will be needed for the work (1) a small
ink roller such as printers use for inking type by hand in taking proofs;
(2) a stout window glass (10×12 is a good size) fastened securely (not
glued, as it may warp and break,) to an evenly planed board about
twice its surface, say 10×24. A small quantity of the ink is put on the
glass and spread with a knife, after which it is distributed evenly by going
over in all directions with the ink roller. When this has been carefully
done the leaf to be copied is laid on a piece of waste paper and inked by
applying the roller once or more with moderate pressure. This leaves a
film of ink on the veins and network of the leaf, which should then be
placed on a piece of blank paper and considerable pressure applied for
a few moments. When the leaf is removed from the paper the work is
done.</p>

<p>“To get the best results several points must be carefully noted. Get a
quarter or half a pound of dark green ink, which is put up in collapsible
tubes costing from fifty cents to $2 per pound, according to quality. As
sold it is invariably too thick for this purpose, and should be thinned
by adding several drops of balsam of copaiba to as much ink as may be
taken on a salt spoon. Much depends on the proper consistency of the
ink. In inking the leaf is liable to curl on the roller, but it should part
readily from it. In case it sticks tightly the ink is too thick. Take
care that the ink is evenly distributed on the glass and roller, as it is
essential that each part of the leaf receives an equal coating of ink. If
the leaf is large ink it part by part, keeping the roller well supplied.
A roller three inches long, costing forty cents, will answer for all small
leaves and branches of plants. Clean the roller and glass with benzine
after using. If the leaf is finely veined the lower surface makes the
better print, but if the veins are coarse and large the upper surface may
be used. If the specimen is fleshy or brittle allow it to wilt until it
becomes more pliable, or if necessary it may be pressed and dried first.
In most cases the best copy is obtained after taking one or two impressions,
as the leaf takes the ink better after several applications. A good
quality of unsized paper that is made slightly damp by placing between
sheets of moist newspaper is best for general work, but in other cases
well sized paper will take a copy that will allow a foliotype (may I coin
the word?) to bear inspection side by side with a good lithograph. I
find a copying press very valuable in making the impression, especially
if the leaf is at all coriaceous. If it be soft it should be covered with a
few thicknesses of newspaper. If it is irregular in thickness, paper
may be laid over the thin parts, so that equal pressure is received. This
is necessary with all leaves that have thick stems. If the branch is very
irregular or delicate, or in the absence of a press of any kind, the specimen
may be covered with several layers of paper, and held in place by<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>
one hand while the pressure is applied by the thumb or palm of the
other hand as required.</p>

<p>“These particulars are as complete as practicable. Experiments will
lead to many improvements in details. Employ tact and neatness, and
you will be surprised at the result.”</p>


<h3>Fire-Extinguishers.</h3>

<h4>Hand Grenades.</h4>

<p>Prof. F.&nbsp;S. Kedzie of the Michigan State Agricultural College, after a
series of analyses and experiments, draws some important conclusions
as to the value of hand-​grenades, in a paper which he publishes in the
Chicago Sanitary News. A Harden hand-​grenade was opened, and the
solution contained qualitatively analyzed. It consisted of common
salt, sulphate of lime, and a small amount of acetate of soda. The principal
ingredient was common salt.</p>

<p>The effort was made to determine (1) whether the solution in the
grenades had any more extinguishing power than water; (2) if the solution
had extinguishing power greater than water, what was the essential
ingredient in the solution. The question that first arose regarding the
composition of the grenades was: Did they contain carbon dioxide gas
or any substance that would give up the gas by being heated? Opening
the grenades under water and collecting the gas that escaped it was
found that the average amount of carbon dioxide contained was about
one cubic inch per grenade. Boiling the solution liberated a slight
amount of gas in addition; but altogether the gas was not enough to be
of any practical benefit in extinguishing fire. It was then certain that
the extinguishing power was in the solution itself. Replacing the solution
in the grenade with pure water the extinguishing power, while
greater than water thrown from a dish upon flaming boards, was still
much less than the power exerted by the solution.</p>

<p>By a careful series of trials it was found that the essential ingredient
was common salt. From a number of experiments it was found that
when a grenade, or a bottle containing a strong brine, was broken in
the midst of the burning kerosene the flames were almost instantly extinguished.
A vapor seemed to spread in all directions from where the
salt solution struck the board, extinguishing the flame as it went.
Strong solutions were also made of sulphate of soda, hyposulphite of
soda, borax (biborate of soda), and bicarbonate of soda and tried as fire
extinguishers. Some worked as well, but none any better, than common
salt in extinguishing fire. The experiment was then made of charging
the bottles with brine and generating carbon dioxide by adding lime
dust and sulphuric acid and corking tightly. No practical increase in
extinguishing power from this addition was noticed. In most instances
the carbon dioxide gas escaped from the bottles inside of four days,
proving that it is impracticable to attempt to use glass vessels with
corks as a means of storing CO<sub>2</sub> under pressure for fire extinguishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span></p>

<p>The conclusion reached from these and many more experiments was
that the Harden grenade solution possesses <i>much greater</i> extinguishing
power than water alone, and that it owed this power to common salt
held in solution. We then constructed some home-​made grenades, using
flat bottles bound together side by side with wire. Using two bottles in
this way insures their being broken in striking the burning body, which
would not always occur when only one bottle is used. Bottles thus
charged with brine and bound together were broken side by side with
the Harden grenades and found to be equally valuable.</p>

<p>It thus appears from the experiment that any person can construct as
good and effective grenades as those offered in the market at $7 and $10
per dozen. Bottles filled with brine and placed around the premises
will afford considerable protection, especially when used upon the
flames when the fire just begins. Salt solutions have the further advantage
of not being easily frozen&mdash;never enough to burst the bottles.</p>

<p>The Lewis hand fire-extinguisher was next investigated. This consists
of a tin tube about two feet long containing thirty-four fluid ounces
of soda in weak caustic ammonia. From the trials made we could not
notice any appreciable superiority over the salt solution as used in the
Harden grenade. It has the disadvantage of not being made to break
by being thrown, but must be opened by having a cork extracted from
one end of the tube, requiring a smart jerk. The solution is then
sprinkled on the fire by the operator.</p>

<p>We herewith append a number of fire-extinguishing compounds, all
of which are highly recommended by various authorities:</p>

<h3>Transferring Photographs.</h3>

<p class="subhd">[ON GLASS.]</p>

<p>This beautiful and valuable process of transferring photographs in
plain or colored work has been taught at high prices under various
high-​sounding names, such as “Roman art,” etc. Photographs can be
transferred and preserved for years which would have been soiled, faded,
and ruined if allowed to remain on the card.</p>

<p>Separate the paper print from the background or card by steaming
it, after which dry thoroughly. Warm the glass slightly and coat evenly
with balsam or negative varnish and place the print face downward on
the surface thus prepared. After smoothing it carefully set away in a
cool place until the varnish has hardened. Then apply water, and with
a soft piece of gum rubber rub off the paper so as to leave the photographic
image on the varnished glass.</p>


<h3>Stamping Patterns.</h3>

<p>Draw the pattern upon heavy paper and perforate with small holes
all the lines with the point of some sharp instrument, dust the following
powder through the perforations, remove the pattern and pass a warm
iron over the fabric, when the pattern will become fixed. Any desired
color can be used, such as Prussian blue, chrome green, yellow, vermilion,
etc.:</p>

<h3>Magic Paper.</h3>

<p class="subhd">[FOR TRANSFERRING AND COPYING.]</p>

<p>This paper is really a valuable article, and is manufactured and sold
under various names, such as the “stylograph,” “rapid copying process,”
etc. It is used principally by salesmen in keeping a record of their
sales, as three copies can be taken simultaneously with one writing. In
this way traveling salesmen can with one writing give a copy of his sale
to his customer (which is frequently demanded), another he can send to
his firm, and retain the third one for his own use. It is used in a similar
manner in nearly all the large stores, and by many individuals in their
business correspondence. It is also valuable for transferring figures in
embroidery and taking impressions of leaves for herbariums, etc., which
it does beautifully, but for the latter purpose nothing equals the foliotype
method previously explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span></p>

<p>The paper is made by mixing pure lard or sweet oil to the consistence
of cream with either of the following paints, the color of which is
desired: Prussian blue, lamp black, Venetian red, or chrome green,
either of which should be rubbed with a knife on a plate or flat surface
until smooth. Use rather thin but firm paper; put on with a sponge and
wipe off as dry as possible. Lay the sheets between uncolored paper or
newspaper, and press by laying books or some other flat substance upon
them until the surplus oil is absorbed, when it is ready for use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For Copying Letters and Orders.</span>&mdash;Either <i>two</i> or <i>three</i> copies can
be made at one time, as desired. To make <i>two</i> copies place a sheet of
the magic paper between the two sheets selected for the order, bill, or
letter, and write upon the upper sheet with a hard lead pencil (the
harder the lead the cleaner the copy). It is best to place a piece of hard
cardboard under all the sheets while writing.</p>

<p>To make <i>three</i> copies use two sheets of magic paper, placing one between
the first and second leaves and the other between the second and
third leaves. Proceed as in taking two copies by writing upon the top
leaf. A stout, thin linen paper will produce the best results, but almost
any kind will do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Transfer Embroidery Patterns.</span>&mdash;Place a piece of thin paper
over the embroidery to prevent soiling; then lay on the magic paper and
put on the cloth you wish to take the copy on to embroider; pin fast and
rub over with a spoon-handle, and every part of the raised figure will
show upon the plain cloth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Take Impressions of Leaves.</span>&mdash;Place the leaf between two
sheets of the magic paper and rub it over hard; then take the leaf out
and place it between two sheets of white paper; rub again, and you will
have a beautiful impression of both sides of the leaf or flower.</p>

<h3>Universal Stain Table.</h3>

<p>Showing at a glance what means to employ in removing any kind of
stain from any kind of fabric. Red acid stains are destroyed by ammonia,
followed by thorough washing with water. Burn stains of nitric
acid are permanent. Great care must be observed when ether and benzine
are used. Keep the open bottle and the fabric being cleaned away
from an open fire or blaze. The ether especially is so volatile that an
open bottle will take fire from a gas-jet or blaze several feet away if the
draft is right. You cannot be too careful.</p>

<p>Boil a short time, stirring occasionally; then let it settle and pour off
the clear liquid into a bottle or jug and cork for use. Soak your clothes
over night in simple water; wring out and soap wrist-bands, collars,

<h3>How I Iron Shirts.</h3>

<p class="subhd">BY MRS. HUSBANDPLEASER.</p>

<p>Take two ounces of spermaceti, one ounce of white wax, one ounce
of paraffine. Mix and put in a saucer over a tea-kettle in which water
is boiling, until melted, stirring several times. Then let it get cold,
after which put in a clean box for use.</p>

<p>To make the starch: For two shirts, collars, and cuffs take one table-spoonful
of starch dissolved in water; shave a piece of the above into it
the size of a bean. Pour boiling water into it until thick, cook twenty
minutes and set away to cool. Take one table-spoonful of starch, dis<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>solve
it in cold water, and when the boiled starch gets lukewarm pour
it over it, stir well, and strain. Have the garments dry and lay the starch
on the wrong side and work it through. Be careful that the starch is
rubbed in until the right side is wet all over. When well saturated roll
up tight in a clean cloth. They need not lay but a few minutes. Stretch
them on a bosom-board, and with a damp cloth rub out all the wrinkles.
Lay a fine cloth over and iron it twice. If a collar or cuff turn it over
and do the same on the other side. Take off the cloth and iron perfectly
dry. If the bosom has pleats raise them before ironing dry and dry
under them. After the bosom is perfectly dry (for this polishing process
you need a good, smooth, hard board about two by one and a half feet&mdash;the
harder the better&mdash;a marble slab of that size is better still), put the
bosom on the bare board, dip a clean white cloth in water, wring almost
dry, rub lightly over the bosom, then rub it with a dry cloth, and polish
with back of iron or with polishing iron. If any dirt gets on rub off
with a damp cloth and polish again. The polishing is not necessarily
done the same day they are ironed. If your time is limited, or your
work interrupted by callers or other duties, lay them aside after having
ironed them perfectly dry.</p>

<p>This makes the very best quality of bluing at a slight cost.</p>


<h3>Family Washing Soaps.</h3>

<p>We see no reason why every economical housewife should not profit
by these simple methods of preparing cheap laundry soap, as they are
the results of practical experience.</p>

<h4>Best Soft Soap.</h4>

<p>Take 4 pounds of white bar soap, cut it fine, and dissolve by heating
in 4 gallons of soft water, after which add 1 pound of sal soda. Dissolve
and mix thoroughly. If it is desired the soap can be made thicker by
adding less water.</p>

<h4>Hard Soap With Lard.</h4>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Sal soda and lard, each</span><span class="amt">6</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;pounds.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Soft water</span><span class="amt">4</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;gallons.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Dissolve the lime and soda in the water by boiling, stirring, and
settling; pour off, then return to the kettle (brass or copper), add the
lard and boil it until it becomes soap. Then pour into a dish or molds,
and when cool cut it into bars and dry it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span></p>

<h4>White Hard Soap With Tallow.</h4>

<p>Take 2 pounds each of fresh-slacked lime, sal soda, and tallow; dissolve
the soda in 1 gallon of boiling soft water, stirring occasionally
every few hours after which let it settle, pouring off the clear liquor and
boiling the tallow therein until it is all dissolved; cool it in a flat box
or pan, and cut into bars or cakes as desired. It may be perfumed with
oil of sassafras or any other perfume desired, stirring it in when cool.</p>


<h3>Cleaning Soiled Wall-paper.</h3>

<p>The old form of this process was to use stale bread or bread baked
to a proper consistency, but it seldom produces satisfactory results except
in the hands of experts, and then it is an impossibility to keep
from scratching the surface of the paper with the sharp points of the
crust. A dough preparation known only to a few experts engaged in
cleaning walls by contract, and who have been known to make from $5
to $25 per day, is now used, which is far superior in every way to anything
yet discovered. The walls can be cleaned over and over again,
each time appearing as bright as new paper.</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="scripr"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Wheat flour</span></div></td><td class="tal">Three parts.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="scripr"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Powdered prepared whiting</span></div></td><td class="tal">One part.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Mix the flour and whiting thoroughly, and add enough water to
bring it to the consistency of ordinary dough. Use by taking a small
piece&mdash;about twice the size of a hen’s egg. Press against the wall and
remove the dirt by making long strokes. After making a stroke knead
the dirt into the dough, and continue doing so until it is useless. A
quart of the preparation used in this manner will clean the walls of a
good-sized room.</p>

<p>When it is desired to keep the ingredients of the composition a secret
a coloring matter may be added to assist in mystifying. When the walls
are discolored by grease or marks where people have rested their heads,
mix pipeclay to the consistency of cream, lay it on the spot and allow it
to remain until the following day, when it may be easily removed with
a penknife or brush.</p>

<p>Reduce the fossil silica to a very fine powder and mix it with the
iron; melt the petrolatum, add the cotton-seed oil, stir in the powders,
and while cooling add the flavoring oil and stir until ready to set, then
run into boxes similar to ordinary blacking boxes. Apply with a soft
rag dipped in the paste, and finish with a clean cloth. Prepared chalk
or whiting can be used instead of fossil silica. The paste does its work
faster than the polishing powder, and if the articles are very much
corroded it is preferable.</p>

<p>Another excellent paste, which can be put in boxes or formed into
balls and allowed to harden, is to take finely powdered rotten-stone,
sift it thoroughly through muslin or a hair sieve, and knead with a
sufficient quantity of soft soap to form a stiff paste. To <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> pound of this

<p>Moisten calcined magnesia with pure benzine. The mixture should
be preserved in bottles with glass stoppers, as the benzine is very volatile.
Use by placing a little of the mixture on a wad of cotton and
apply to the glass.</p>


<h3>Marble Cleaning.</h3>

<p>Rub with muriatic acid diluted with water, care being taken that it
is not too strong. Repeat the process till clean, then wash with clear
water. When the marble is very dirty, as in the case of old tombstones,
use the following:</p>

<h3>Maple Syrup and Sugar.</h3>

<p class="subhd">[ARTIFICIAL.]</p>

<p>It is an astonishing fact that nine-tenths of the so-called maple sugar
and maple syrup sold as the genuine articles are nothing more than
clever imitations. The method of making the best quality of these imitations&mdash;and
which really defies detection of a majority of dealers and
consumers&mdash;is very cheap and simple, a gallon of the syrup costing
about fifty cents and the sugar simply the cost of ordinary, cheap sugar.
We were told by a Mr. Baldwin of Kentucky, a son of the reputed discoverer
of the secret for producing the maple flavoring, that various
manufacturers of imitation maple sugar and syrup in the large cities
had paid his father thousands of dollars in royalties for his discovery.</p>

<p>Procure a quantity of the rough outside bark of what is known as scaly-bark
hickory tree. Take about 3 or 4 pounds of the bark and boil in
one-half gallon of water until it is reduced to a quart, then strain and
add 5 pounds of common brown or yellow sugar; heat again until thoroughly
dissolved and it is ready for use. To make imitation maple
syrup simply boil the syrup until it is reduced back to sugar again, and
when it is made properly the flavor and appearance of the genuine article
is obtained.</p>

<h3>Baking Powders.</h3>

<p>Pure baking powders are very simple in composition, care being
used in preparing them and procuring pure ingredients. According to
the advertised statements of the various leading manufacturers we are<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
forced to make our own if we desire a pure and wholesome article. As
the essential ingredients of the best baking powder are baking soda and
cream of tartar we need only be careful in buying of honest grocers or
druggists who will guarantee their purity. It is not difficult to procure
pure soda, but the cream of tartar is frequently adulterated, and care
must be used in its purchase.</p>

<p>It is very important that the materials used must be finely powdered,
perfectly dry, and thoroughly mixed. For household purposes a patent
sifter is the best to use in mixing. Run the articles through a number
of times and free from all lumps. The ingredients can be dried by
placing them in an oven for a short time before mixing.</p>

<h4>Baking Powder No. 1.</h4>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Pure cream of tartar</span><span class="amt">2</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;pounds.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Corn starch</span><span class="amt">2</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounces.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This is the best that can be made. One to two tea-spoonfuls to a
quart of flour.</p>

<h4>Baking Powder No. 2.</h4>

<p>A cheaper powder, but superior to the majority of powders you will
buy, is prepared as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Pure cream of tartar</span><span class="amt">2</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Pure bicarbonate of soda</span><span class="amt">2</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;pounds.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Tartaric acid</span><span class="amt">6</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Corn starch</span><span class="amt">1</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;pound.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Best flour</span><span class="amt">4</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;pounds.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Use two tea-spoonfuls to a quart of flour. Do not be afraid of the
tartaric acid, as it is harmless. It is best to keep your baking powder
in a well-stopped jar or bottle. Flour, terra alba, alum, and chalk are
the chief ingredients used in the adulteration of cream of tartar. To
determine the admixture of flour rub a few grains of iodine with one
ounce of the suspected cream of tartar; if so adulterated a blue tint to
the mixture will be produced; or by dissolving a small quantity in
water you can prove its presence by the stickiness. Chalk may be determined
by its effervescing on the addition of diluted acids; alum by
dissolving in hot water and allowing the solution to chrystallize; terra
alba and other clays by their insolubility in a hot solution of caustic
potassa.</p>


<h3>Flavoring Extracts.</h3>

<p>The profits to manufacturers and dealers on these household necessities
are very large, and the prudent consumer will take advantage of the
directions here given. Extracts of lemon and vanilla are most frequently
used; nutmeg, mace, cinnamon, etc., are usually used dry by
grating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span></p>


<h4>Best Lemon Extract.</h4>

<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Oil of lemon</span><span class="amt">1</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounce.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Cut the peels of two lemons into fine pieces and add to the alcohol
and oil of lemon. Let stand for a few days and filter through a felt bag
or filtering paper.</p>


<h4>Extract of Vanilla.</h4>

<p>Extract of vanilla is prepared direct from the vanilla bean. Use
care in the purchase of the beans, as there are several varieties. The
Mexican vanilla beans have the finest flavor, and the longer the bean, as
a rule, the better the extract. There are other excellent varieties of
vanilla beans, but they have a somewhat ranker flavor than the Mexican.
Unscrupulous jobbers and dealers have been known to soak the whole
beans in spirits, practically stealing all their flavor, and then by drying
them place them on the market. They can be detected by their light
color and brittleness. Most of the vanilla extracts sold for flavoring
purposes are adulterated with Tonka beans and other adulterants,
some containing not a particle of vanilla.</p>

<p>The following will make a splendid article, and you know what you
are getting without paying high prices for weak extracts put up in deceptive
little panel bottles. Dishonest manufacturers never yield a
point in their efforts to defraud. Not content with the liberty they take
with the contents they employ the bottle-makers’ art to deceive us in
the quantity of the precious stuff:</p>


<div class="center">

<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Water</span><span class="amt">4</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounces.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Slit the beans and cut them very fine, then mix them with sugar and
bruise until moderately fine; then mix with spirits and water and put in
a warm place; allow to stand for two weeks (longer the better) shaking
every day, and when through filter. Manufacturers color with caramel
or other coloring, but for home use this is unnecessary.</p>

<h4>To Extract Essential Oils.</h4>

<p>To extract essential oils from wood, bark, herbs, etc., put a quantity
of the herb or other article into a bottle or jar and pour in a small quantity
of ether. Keep in a cool place several hours, and then fill the bottle
with cold water. The essential oil will rise to the surface, and may be
easily separated.</p>


<h3>How to Make Rubber Stamps.</h3>

<p>The wording of the desired rubber stamp having been correctly set
up in ordinary type, the same is locked up and placed upon a level support.
Around it is put an iron frame, which will determine the shape
and size of the matrix.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span></p>

<p>By means of a soft brush the type as well as all surrounding parts
that are to be covered by the plaster of Paris are well oiled.</p>

<p>For the purpose of making the cast finely ground fresh plaster of Paris
is needed; if of long standing, the same will lose its desirable properties.
This plaster of Paris, of which a sufficient quantity should at one
time be mixed to the consistency of pap, using clear water, is poured
over the frame containing the type in a thin layer, so as to barely cover
it. With a stout brush the mixture is driven into all spaces and interstices,
until all details are thoroughly covered. After this the remaining
pap of plaster of Paris is added until the frame is full to overflowing.
The surface is smoothed down after the plaster has settled somewhat,
and in a short while the matrix in the frame may be removed from
the type.</p>

<p>After this it becomes necessary to bake the matrix in an oven for a
period of from four to six hours. When thoroughly baked the matrix
should be well brushed with a thin solution of shellac to impart a
smooth surface, and at the same time greater strength.</p>

<p>The matrix at this stage represents a yellowish-white block, in which
the lettering appears indented, but in proper place. The indentation
corresponds to the height of the letter upon the piece of type or the
marks upon a cut, while the remaining parts should be perfectly smooth
and free from holes. This matrix, obtained by a coating from the type
or cut, will serve as the mould for the final rubber stamp.</p>

<p>Pieces of caoutchouc are cut to the required size and laid upon the
matrix. If pressure is now exerted the soft mass will adjust itself to fill
all the spaces and reproduce the mould invertedly. Indentations become
raised matter, and the whole will show as did primarily the type.</p>

<p>But as the caoutchouc has a tendency to return to its previous shape
it becomes necessary to apply the process called vulcanizing. The object
is to impart hardness to the rubber, and to prevent its losing the
form into which it has been pressed.</p>

<p>To accomplish this the caoutchouc must be heated to a temperature
of from 120 to 130 deg. C. As the substance is ordinarily softened by heat
it is necessary to take some means to prevent it from sticking to the
mould. For the purpose soapstone will answer, and the mould, as well
as the piece of caoutchouc, should be well brushed or dusted with this
substance.</p>

<p>The duration of the heating varies with the thickness of the rubber
sheet. As a general thing from twenty to thirty minutes ought to be
sufficient. It may be mentioned here that special apparatus can be
purchased for pressing and vulcanizing. The proper vulcanization is
of the greatest importance in determining the durability of the stamp.</p>

<p>All that remains to complete the stamps is the mounting of the rubber
plate upon a suitable base or handle. This is best done either with
zinc or with a solution of caoutchouc in benzine. The surface of the
handle, as well as the back part of the stamps, having been covered with
such a solution and well pressed together, after drying the entire stamp
will be ready for use.&mdash;<i>Amer. Lith. and Printer.</i></p>

<h3>Vermin Exterminators.</h3>

<h4>Phosphorus or Luminous Paste.</h4>

<p>This is an unequaled preparation for destroying rats, mice, cockroaches,
etc. It attracts them by its luminous appearance and also by
its odor, which is very attractive to all vermin. They eat it with great
avidity.</p>

</table></div>

<p>Cook the flour and water to a thin paste; add the phosphorus&mdash;previously
melted in a little hot water&mdash;and mix; then add the rest and stir
until thoroughly mixed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Other Methods of Destroying Rats.</span>&mdash;(1) Mix some fine plaster
of Paris with an equal quantity of flour; put the mixture in the place infested
by the vermin and a vessel full of water beside it. The rats will
devour the mixture and then drink, whereupon the plaster, brought into
contact with the water, will become solid and like a stone in their
stomachs, which will cause their deaths. (2) When a house is infested
with rats which refuse to nibble at toasted cheese or the usual baits, a
few drops of oil of rhodium poured on or near the bait will attract
them while the most tempting baits fail. (3) Cover the floor near
their holes and place into their haunts a quantity of caustic potash.
This they lick with their tongues, which makes their mouths sore, and
they not only shun this locality, but appear to tell all the neighboring
rats about it. (4) Instead of using chloride of lime or potash a quantity
of tar can be smeared in and around their haunts and they will disappear.
Tar and rats do not agree. If a live rat be caught, smeared with tar, and
allowed to escape into the holes he will do the smearing process thoroughly.</p>

<h3><a id="Inks"></a>Inks.</h3>

<p>Late improvements in the manufacture of inks are due to the discovery
and cheapening of substances which can be used in preparing
them. While good common writing inks are quite easily procured in
the market, still they can be manufactured much cheaper by the consumer;
and then again there are a variety of special purposes which require
inks that are not on sale, and formulas for making them are very
valuable. In this collection we give approved and tested formulas for
everything in the ink line.</p>

<h4>Fine Black Ink.</h4>

<p class="subhd">[FROM LOGWOOD.]</p>

<p>A good black ink can be made by boiling 3 pounds of logwood with
sufficient water to leave a residue of 5 quarts. When cold add 3 drachms
of yellow bichromate of potash and stir thoroughly. To prevent thick<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>ening
add a few drops of solution of mercury salt. It flows freely from
the pen. Its color at first is of a dark indigo-blue tint, changing soon
into a permanent black. A beautiful gloss may be given to this or any
other black ink by adding a strong solution of shellac and borax.</p>

<h4>Fine Black Ink.</h4>

<p class="subhd">[FROM ANILINE.]</p>

<p>Dissolve the negrosine in a quart of hot water; dissolve the corrosive
sublimate and dextrine in the remaining quart, and pour all together.
This is a splendid ink, flows freely from the pen, and will keep well.</p>

<p>In making ink use care in buying the best anilines and other ingredients.
This is important.</p>

<h4>Copying Ink.</h4>

<p>Take 1 pint of the violet-black ink and add 1 ounce each of sugar

press is used. For what is termed dry copying mix about <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">3</span></span></span> pint of
glycerine to a pint of any good black ink. The manuscript, if written
on glazed paper, will not dry for hours, and will yield one or two fair,
neat, dry copies by simple pressure of the hand. The writing should
not be excessively fine nor the strokes uneven or heavy. The copies and
the original are neater than when water is used.</p>

<h4>Hektograph Ink.</h4>

<p class="subhd">(SEE PAGE <a href="#Page_1">1</a>.)</p>

<p>A good purple ink to use on the gelatine copying pad, or hektograph,
is prepared as follows:</p>

<div class="center">

after which wash off the beeswax and acids and rub over with a little
sweet oil to prevent further rust or tarnish.</p>

<h4>Ink Powders.</h4>

<p>As in the case of fluid inks there are many formulas for preparing
ink powders. The following are the best:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black.</span>&mdash;Nut-galls, 1 ounce; copperas, <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> ounce; gum Arabic, 7 ounces.
Add one clove to this quantity. Or, take negrosine, 1 ounce; dextrine,
3 ounces; mix.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blue.</span>&mdash;Water blue aniline, 1 ounce; dextrine, 5 ounces. Or, soluble
Prussian blue, <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> ounce; dextrine, 1 ounce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Green.</span>&mdash;Aniline green, 44 parts; gelatine, 4 parts, and lunar caustic,
2 parts. Or, green aniline, 1 part; dextrine, 4 parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red.</span>&mdash;Eosine aniline, 1 ounce; dextrine, 1 ounce.</p>

<p>A tea-spoonful to a table-spoonful of the powder is dissolved in 1
pint of water, requiring from <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> to 1 hour to make the solution.</p>

<h4>Disappearing Ink.</h4>

<p>Boil some nut-galls in aqua fortis, and add to the infusion some gum
Arabic and a little sulphuric acid. When written on paper this ink is
perfectly legible, but will disappear from the paper in a few days.</p>

<h4>Invisible Ink.</h4>

<p>Invisible inks are those which when first written are not visible, but
upon the application of heat or other means the characters are made to
appear distinctly. The following are decidedly the best preparations
for this purpose:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Oil of vitriol</span><span class="amt">1</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;fluid ounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Soft water</span><span class="amt">1</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;pint.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This makes a fluid which is perfectly invisible until heat is applied
by holding over a lamp or by placing in an oven, when it changes to a
permanent black. Write with a clean steel pen. All invisible inks
will show on glazed paper, therefore unglazed paper should be used.</p>

<p>Another singular invisible ink is made as follows: Oxide of cobalt,
<span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> ounce; muriatic acid, sufficient to dissolve it; water, 4 ounces; mucilage
of gum acacia, 1 drachm. Place in a stained bottle. Characters
written with this solution are invisible, but on the application of heat
they instantly appear in blue. On cooling they again become invisible.</p>

<p>To erase ink dip the end of a penholder or pencil in No. 1 and apply
to the writing, and do the same with No. 2. Let remain a moment and
blot off with clean blotting-paper. If the characters are not erased repeat
as before.</p>


<h3>Cements and Glue.</h3>

<h4>Armenian Glue.</h4>

<p>The jewellers of Turkey, who are mostly Armenians, have a singular
method of ornamenting watch cases, etc., with diamonds and other
precious stones by simply gluing or cementing them on. The stone is
set in gold or silver and the lower part of the metal made flat, or to correspond
to that part to which it is to be fixed. It is then warmed
gently and the glue applied, which is so very strong that the parts thus
cemented never separate. For this glue, which will firmly unite bits of
glass and even polished steel, and which may of course be applied to
a vast variety of useful purposes, large number of formulas have been
published. The following is the original recipe. Dissolve 5 or 6 bits of
gum mastic, each the size of a large pea, in as much alcohol as will
suffice to render them liquid; in another vessel dissolve as much isinglass,
previously softened a little in water (though none of the water
must be used), in good brandy or rum as will make a two-ounce vial of
very strong glue, adding two small bits of galbanum or ammoniacum,
which must be rubbed or ground until they are dissolved. Then mix
the whole with a sufficient heat. Keep the glue in a vial closely corked,
and when it is to be used set the vial in boiling water. To avoid cracking
the vial by exposure to such sudden heat use a thin green glass vial
and hold it in the steam for a few seconds before immersing it in the
hot water.&mdash;<i>Workshop Receipts.</i></p>

<p>Melt in a water bath, and add 10 parts of slaked lime. The cement
commonly used for fastening the tops on kerosene lamps is plaster of
Paris, which is porous, quickly penetrated by the kerosene, and readily
destroyed. A cement which does not have this defect is made by boiling
3 parts of resin and 1 of caustic soda in 5 of water. This composition
forms a soap, which mix with half its weight of plaster of Paris.
Use while fresh.</p>


<h3>Pastes.</h3>

<h4>Paste for Wall-paper, Etc.</h4>

<p>Dissolve <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">8</span></span></span> ounce of salicylic acid in half a gallon of warm water, and
when cold stir in as much flour as will bring it to the consistency of
cream, being particular to break up all the lumps; next place it on the
fire and allow it to cook gently for a few minutes, stirring well meanwhile.
This paste answers a variety of purposes. The salicylic acid is
to keep it from spoiling. The addition of 1 ounce of powdered colocynth
to the above amount will effectually banish all insects and worms
from the walls where the paper is pasted.</p>

<h4>Paste for Labeling on Tin.</h4>

<p>Ordinary pastes will not adhere labels to tin. The following is a
good one: Make a paste of gum tragacanth and add a little oil of wintergreen.
Apply by removing the film of grease from the tin by a solution
of caustic soda (10 parts of water to 1 of soda). Apply with a rag to the
spot on which you wish to affix the label.</p>

<h4>Paste to Fasten Cloth or Leather on Wooden Surfaces.</h4>

<p>Rub together till a uniform paste is formed, transfer to a small kettle
over a fire, heat, and stir until the lumps are all dissolved and the
paste becomes stiff; transfer to another vessel and cover up. This paste
is applied in a thin layer to the surface of the table or desk to be
covered, the cloth or leather is then laid on and smoothed with a roller.
If leather is to be fastened on it must be first dampened.</p>

<h3>Whitewash and Paints.</h3>

<h4>Brilliant Stucco Whitewash.</h4>

<p>This is a time-tried whitewash, either for inside or outside work, and
has been known to retain its brilliancy for over thirty years. Nice unslaked
lime, <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> bushel; slake it with boiling water; cover it during the
process to keep in the steam. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve or
strainer, and add to it <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> bushel of salt, previously well dissolved in
water; rice, 3 pounds&mdash;boiled to a thin paste and stirred in boiling hot;
Spanish whiting, <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> pound; best glue, 1 pound, which has been previously
dissolved by soaking it well, and then hanging it over a slow fire
in a small kettle immersed in a larger one filled with water. Now add
hot water, 5 gallons, to the mixture, stir well, and let it stand a few days
covered from the dirt. It should be put on hot. For this purpose it is
best to keep it in a kettle on a portable furnace, or use other means
more convenient. It answers as well as oil paint for brick or stone, and
is much cheaper.</p>

<p>Coloring matter, dissolved in alcohol, may be put in and made of any
shade you like. Spanish brown stirred in will make red-pink, more or
less deep, according to quantity. A delicate tinge of this is very pretty
for inside walls. Finely pulverized common clay, well mixed with
Spanish white, makes reddish stone color. Yellow ochre stirred in
makes yellow wash, but chrome goes further, and makes a color generally
esteemed prettier. In all these cases the darkness of the shade is
of course determined by the quantity of the coloring used. It is difficult
to make rules, because tastes differ. It would be best to try experiments
on a shingle, and let it dry. Green must not be mixed with lime. The
lime destroys the color, and the color has an effect on the whitewash
which makes it crack and peel. When inside walls have been badly
smoked and you wish to make them a clean, clear white, it is well to
squeeze indigo plentifully through a bag into the water you use before
it is stirred into the whole mixture; or blue vitriol pulverized and dissolved
in boiling water and put into whitewash gives a beautiful blue
tint. If a larger quantity than five gallons be wanted the same proportions
should be observed.</p>

<h4>Durable Paint for Tin Roofs.</h4>

</table></div>

<p>The coloring substances are pulverized and the mixture ground.
Should the mixture be too thick reduce it with equal parts of linseed
oil and oil of turpentine. Give the roof two coats, allowing the first to
dry before applying the second. See that the tin is free from rust, and
the coats should not be laid on too thick nor too thin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span></p>

<h4>Paint for Roofs.</h4>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>Mix, and add one-half its volume of pure coal-tar and boil to a fluid
mass.</p>

<p>This paint gives a very durable and pliant covering, which does not
melt in the greatest heat of summer nor crack or break in the greatest
cold. It resists moisture, and a roof painted with it need not be gone
over again for four or five years.</p>

<h4>Paint for Blackboards.</h4>

<p>Common glue, 4 ounces; flour of emery, 3 ounces, and just lampblack
enough to give an inky color to the preparation. Dissolve the glue in
<span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">3</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> quart of warm water, put in the lampblack and emery, stir till there
are no lumps, then apply to the board with a woolen rag smoothly
rolled. Three coats should be given.</p>

<h4>Removing Smell of Paint.</h4>

<p>Place a vessel of lighted charcoal in the room and place on it two or
three handfuls of juniper berries; shut the windows, chimneys, and
doors and twenty-four hours afterward the room may be opened, when
it will be found that the sickly, unwholesome smell will be gone. Another
very simple method is to plunge a handful of hay into a pail of
water and let it stand in the newly-painted room.</p>

<h4>Paint Remover.</h4>

<p>To remove dry paint or hard putty make a saturated solution of
caustic of potassa with water. Apply to the paint with a swab. After
a short time it will be easily removed.</p>


<h3>Staining Wood.</h3>

<h4>Ebonizing Wood.</h4>

<div class="center">

<tr><td class="tal">Water, sufficient.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Boil the logwood for 30 minutes in a gallon of water, and then add
the copperas and lampblack. Apply to the wood hot, giving a number
of coats. In varnishing ebonized wood a little drop black must be
added to the varnish or it will give a brown shade.</p>

<h4>Staining Wood Rose Color.</h4>

<p>A brilliant and uniform rose color can be imparted to wood and vegetable
ivory by chemical precipitation, as follows: The first bath consists
of 8 parts of potassium iodide to 100 parts of water. The second
bath is prepared by mixing <span class="nowrap">2 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> parts of corrosive sublimate with 100<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
parts of water. Immerse the wood for a few hours in the first bath,
then place it in the second, in which it will acquire a beautiful rose
color. Varnish the wood after drying. Both baths can be repeatedly
used without renewing them.</p>

<h4>Imitation of Cedar.</h4>

<p>Mix 2 parts by weight of catechu, 1 part of caustic soda, and 100 of
water. The best wood to use is white wood, and after the article is
finished it is boiled in the stain for several hours, rinsed, and dried.
The length of time in boiling depends upon the depth of color desired.
This is a very deep and natural stain.</p>

<h4>Hard Coating for Wood.</h4>

<p>To coat wood with a substance as hard as stone apply the following
mixture while hot with a brush:</p>

<h3>Metal and Glass Secrets.</h3>

<h4>Hardening Composition for Steel.</h4>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>Melt the rosin and pitch together, add the other ingredients, and
heat all in an iron vessel until all moisture is driven out, and the heated
mass ignites from a burning chip of wood held over it; the flame is at
once extinguished by a close-fitting lid.</p>

<p>In using the method for saw blades, they are first heated in a suitable
furnace and then placed vertically, teeth upward, in troughs filled with
the mixture. After sufficient cooling they are taken out and wiped with
a piece of leather so that only a slight film of fat remains. They are
then placed flat over a coal fire until the coating of fat ignites, which
may burn as freely as required for great hardness. Screws, or other
articles which require a less degree of hardness, are dipped into the hot
mixture and brought to a white heat.</p>

<h4>Composition to Toughen Steel.</h4>

<p>Melt together and dip the steel in the mixture when hot.</p>

<h4>To Soften Iron or Steel.</h4>

<p>Anoint the article all over with tallow, temper it in a gentle charcoal
fire, and let it cool itself; or take a little clay, cover your iron with it,
and temper in a charcoal fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span></p>

<h4>Restoring Burnt Steel.</h4>

<p>It is not generally known that burnt steel may be almost instantaneously
restored by plunging it while hot in cold water and hammering it
with light strokes on the anvil, turning it so as to hammer all over it,
again dipping in the cold water, and repeating the hammering process
as before. Try again if you do not succeed the first time.</p>

<h4>Welding Cast-Steel.</h4>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Rock saltpeter</span><span class="amt"><span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span></span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;pound.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Water</span><span class="amt">1 </span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;gallon.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Dissolve the saltpeter in the vitriol and add it to the water. After
scarfing the steel get it hot; and quench in the preparation. Then weld
the same as a piece of iron, hammering it very quickly with light blows.
It answers the purpose much better than borax. Cork it in a bottle and
it will keep for years.</p>

<p>Another:</p>

<div class="center">

<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Cyanide of potassium</span><span class="amt">2</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;parts.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Dissolve all in water, and evaporate the water at a low temperature.</p>

<h4>To Drill Hardened Steel.</h4>

<p>Cover your steel with melted beeswax, and when cold make a hole in
the wax with a fine-pointed needle or other article the size of the hole
you require; put a drop of strong nitric acid upon it, and after an hour
rinse off and apply again. It will gradually eat through.</p>

<h4>To Drill Holes in Cast-Iron.</h4>

<p>By means of carbolic acid a hole <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> of an inch in diameter has been
drilled through <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> inch thickness of cast-iron with a carpenter’s brace.</p>

<h4>To Solder Ferrules for Tool Handles.</h4>

<p>Take your ferrule, lap round the “joining” a small piece of brass
wire, then wet the ferrule, scatter on the joining ground borax, put it
on the end of a wire, and hold it in the fire till the brass fuses. It will
fill up the joining and form a perfect solder. It may afterward be
turned in the lathe.</p>

<h4>Soldering Without a Soldering Iron.</h4>

<p>Cut a piece of a tin-foil the size of the surface to be soldered, then
pass over the surface a solution of sal-ammoniac, place the tin-foil between
the pieces, and heat over a lamp or fire until the foil melts. Instead
of the solution of sal-ammoniac equal parts of water and hydrochloric
acid saturated with zinc can be used just as well.</p>

<h4>To Clean Gun-barrels from Lead.</h4>

<p>Pour in a little mercury, agitate it over the interior surface of the
barrel, and pour it out again. The mercury will amalgamate the lead
and remove it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span></p>

<h4>To Resharpen Old Files.</h4>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Saleratus</span><span class="amt">4</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Water</span><span class="amt">1</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;quart.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Dissolve the saleratus in the water. Boil the old files or rasps in this
solution for half an hour. Then take out, wash, and dry them. Next
stand them in a jar, filling it up with rain water and sulphuric acid in
the proportion of water, 1 quart; sulphuric acid, 4 ounces. Coarse files
should remain in the bath twelve hours and fine ones two or three hours
less. Take them out, wash them clean, dry quickly and thoroughly, and
rub them with sweet oil to prevent rusting.</p>

<p>Another method, though not so effectual, is to pour a few drops of
benzole upon the file and brush thoroughly with a scratch brush.</p>

<h4>Mending Tinware by Candle Heat.</h4>

<p>This is such a simple and cheap way of mending tinware that a person
with just a bit of ingenuity can do his own work in this line. Take
a vial about two-thirds full of muriatic acid and put into it little bits
of sheet zinc as long as the acid will dissolve them. Then put in a
crumb of sal-ammoniac and fill up with water and it is ready for use.
Wet the cork in the vial and with it wet the edges of the place to be
mended. Then put a piece of sheet zinc over the hole and hold a lighted
candle or spirit lamp under the place, which melts the solder on the tin
and causes the zinc to adhere without further trouble. Do not forget to
wet the zinc also with the solution.</p>

<h4>A Good Way to Sharpen Razors.</h4>

<p>Put the razor blade for half an hour in water to which has been added
one-twentieth of its weight of muriatic or sulphuric acid, and after a
few hours “set” it on a hone. The acid acts as a whetstone by corroding
the whole surface uniformly.</p>

<h4>Razor-Strop Paste.</h4>

<p>Moisten flour of emery with tallow or sweet oil.</p>

<h4>Cutting Ovals and Different Shapes on Glass.</h4>

<p>Scratch the glass around the shape you desire with the corner of a file
or graver; then having bent a piece of wire the same shape heat it red-hot
and lay it upon the scratch, and sink the glass into cold water just
deep enough for the water to come almost on a level with its upper surface.
It rarely fails to break perfectly true.</p>

<h4>Etching on Glass.</h4>

</table></div>

<p>Acid sulphuric, a sufficient quantity to decompose the ammonia
fluoride and making the mixture of a semi-fluid consistency. It must
be prepared in a leaden vessel. It can be used with a common pen, but
must be kept in bottles coated inside with paraffine, beeswax, or gutta-percha,
with rubber stoppers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span></p>

<h4>To Drill and Ornament Glass.</h4>

<p>Any hard steel tool will cut glass with great facility when kept freely
wet with camphor dissolved in turpentine. A drill-bow may be used,
or even the hand alone. A hole bored may be readily enlarged by a
round file. The ragged edges of glass vessels may also be thus easily
smoothed by a flat file. Flat window glass can readily be sawed by a
watch-spring saw by aid of this solution. In short, the most brittle
glass can be wrought almost as easily as brass by the use of cutting-tools
kept constantly moist with camphorized oil of turpentine.</p>

<h3>Gold and Silver Imitations.</h3>

<h4>Imitation Gold.</h4>

<p>An American has discovered a beautiful alloy, which has been most
successfully applied as a substitute for gold. It is composed of pure
copper, 100 parts; pure tin, 17 parts; magnesia, 6 parts; tartar of commerce,
9 parts; sal-ammoniac, 3.6 parts, and quicklime, 1.6 parts. The
copper is first melted, then the lime, magnesia, sal-ammoniac, and tartar
are added, little at a time, and the whole is briskly stirred for about
half an hour, so as to mix thoroughly, after which the tin is thrown on
the surface in small grains, stirring until entirely fused. The crucible
is now covered and the fusion kept up for about thirty-five minutes,
when the dross is skimmed off, and the alloy found ready for use. It is
quite maleable and ductile, and may be drawn, stamped, chased, beaten
into powder, or into leaves, like gold leaf, in all of which conditions it
is not distinguishable from gold even by good judges, except by its inferior
weight.</p>

<h4>Imitation Silver.</h4>

pure antimony, <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> part pure bismuth, and 2 parts clear glass. The glass

<h3>Care of Teeth, Mouth, and Breath.</h3>

<p>The teeth, through negligence and ignorance, receive less attention
among the majority of people than any other subject of a personal character.
The care of children’s teeth is very important, and if parents do
not post themselves in the matter frequent visits to a skilled dentist
should in their case be imperatively enforced, as well as upon the older
members of the family.</p>

<p>The first teeth of the infant are called the deciduous or <i>milk</i> teeth,
and are twenty in number&mdash;ten in each jaw. These twenty teeth are as
follows: Eight incisors, four in each jaw&mdash;the four being composed of
two central and two lateral incisors&mdash;also four canine or cuspid teeth,
two in each jaw, and eight molars, four in each jaw&mdash;the molars being
called first and second molars, indicating their relative positions as
well as the periods of their eruption (commonly called cutting). It is
generally recognized among physicians that all diseases of children are
more difficult to treat during dentition than before or after. It is well
enough for parents to recognize this fact in administering medicines to
their children. Although the time of eruptions of the teeth differ with
different persons, yet the following table gives a close approximation:</p>

<p>It would be difficult indeed to condense in so short a space so much
practical information from a reliable source as has been given in the
following prize essay on the teeth, which was awarded by the Dental
Society of Philadelphia:</p>

<p>1st. Cleanse your teeth once, or oftener, every day. Rinse the mouth
after eating. Cleansing the teeth consists in removing every particle of
foreign matter from around the teeth and gums.</p>

<p>2d. To cleanse use well-made brushes, soft quill, or wood toothpicks,
an antacid styptic tooth wash, and precipitated chalk. If these means
fail apply to a regular dentist.</p>

<p>3d. Avoid eating hot food. Thoroughly masticate the food, and well
salivate it before swallowing.</p>

<p>4th. Parents ought to carefully attend to the child’s second dentition.
Prevail upon your children to visit, at frequent intervals, a careful
and skillful operator.</p>

<p>5th. Remember that four of the permanent double teeth come in at
the age of six years. They are very liable to decay early, are very large,
and should never be allowed to require extracting.</p>

<p>6th. Never allow any one to extract a tooth or dissuade you from
having them filled unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>7th. Carelessness and procrastination are responsible for a large
proportion of teeth that are lost.</p>

<p>The teeth were never intended to take the place of nut-crackers nor
to rival scissors in cutting thread. The teeth must be taken care of or
your health will suffer.</p>

<p>Remember, a clean tooth would not decay in a hundred years.</p>

<h3>Removal of Freckles, Moles, Etc.</h3>

<p>The following practical treatise on this much-abused subject is
copied from the <i>B.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;C. Druggist</i>, and although originally written in the
interests of druggists it is of more value to persons affected with these
blemishes; hence we reproduce the essay in its entirety with the formulas
stripped of their technical terms and phrases:</p>

<p>At this time of the year there are few questions which are more frequently
addressed to the “family chemist,” and fewer still to which he
ordinarily gives so unsatisfactory a reply, as, “What shall I do to cure
my freckles?”</p>

<p>Knowing as we do how greatly the popularity&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the business
prosperity&mdash;of the majority of our friends depends upon the votes and
interest of their lady customers, we have been at some pains to lay before
them such an amount of practical information upon the above subject
as will enable them to retain the good will and material gratitude
of their fair interrogators on the one hand, and to put a little extra
profit in their own pockets on the other.</p>

<p>We do not propose to convert these pages into an elaborate treatise
upon the skin; but for the benefit of those who are only just commencing
business it will, perhaps, be as well to make a few observations
which our more experienced friends may consider of the “leather and
prunella” order. In the first place it will be generally admitted that
upon the subject of our present notes there is no published information
of a practical and reliable character, and that medical writers and practitioners
either shun the question altogether or approach it in a perfunctory
manner, and leave it very much where they found it. For our
present purpose the cutaneous discoloration commonly designated by
the term “freckles” may be considered under two heads&mdash;the so-called
“summer” or temporary variety (<i>ephelis</i>), and the permanent kind
(<i>lentigo</i>). Both are commonly stated to be simply morbid alterations of
the skin-pigment, and to be situated solely in the <i>rete mucosum</i>, but
this is not absolutely true, inasmuch as <i>ephelis</i>, properly so called, is
generally due to a darkening of the under surface of the epidermis either
in small ovoid patches (“summer freckles”) or extended over a large
surface (“tan” or “sunburn”), while with <i>lentigo</i> the brownish discolorations
are at a greater depth, and remain <i>in situ</i> after the covering epidermis
has been completely removed. Strong sunshine, or any powerfully
actinic light, and radiant heat from any source are apt to produce
the first named, and to enhance the latter form of the skin’s chromatogenous
function, the manifestations of which vary greatly according
to individual idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>Similarly the treatment which answers best for some persons is not
so efficacious in other cases, but the old, old adage that “prevention is
better than cure” applies here with considerable force, and as regards
the <i>rationale</i> of remedial applications, it may be said in general terms
that the application, in the right place, of active reducing, or deoxidiz<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>ing,
agents is as a rule successful in removing <i>ephelis</i> altogether, and in
greatly toning down the shade of <i>lentigo</i>. Commencing with the mildest
form we will give a good formula for a</p>

<h4>SUNBURN LOTION</h4>

<p>The sulphate of iron must be in clear green crystals, unless the
“granulated” form, which is preferable, be available, and in either case
the salt should be fresh and free from oxidized portions, or “rustiness;”
it should be dissolved in half the elder-flower water (all of which is
better, if not quite recently distilled, for being quickly raised to the
boiling point and cooled out of contact of air before use), the citric
acid being also in solution in the other half, and the two fluids mixed,
filtered if necessary, and bottled immediately, a lump of camphor about
the size of small peppercorn to be added to the contents of each bottle.</p>

<p>The two lotions are stated to give excellent results, especially the
latter. They are to be applied to the skin of the face, etc., in the usual
way, at least twice in the course of twenty-four hours, after it has been
washed and dried carefully. If the skin be of the nature known as
“greasy,” a preliminary wash with tepid water containing a few drops
of stronger water of ammonia is advisable.</p>

<h4>ALBADERMINE.</h4>

<p>Under this empirical title a process of removing “tan” and the
milder variety of “freckles,” a foreign surgeon has devised the following:</p>

<h5>SOLUTION A.</h5>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Infusion of rose leaves</span><span class="amt">4</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounces.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Dissolve the iodide of potassium in a small quantity of the infusion
and a drachm of the glycerine; with this fluid moisten the iodine in a
glass mortar and rub it down, gradually adding more liquid until complete
solution has been obtained; then stir in the remainder of the ingredients,
and bottle the mixture.</p>

<h5>SOLUTION B.</h5>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Hyposulphate of soda</span><span class="amt"><span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span></span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounces.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tal">Dissolve and filter.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>With a small camel’s hair pencil or piece of fine sponge apply a little<span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
of “Albadermine A” to the tanned or freckled surface, until a slight but
tolerably uniform brownish-yellow skin has been produced. At the
expiration of fifteen or twenty minutes moisten a piece of cambric, lint,
or soft rag with “B” and lay it upon the affected part, removing, squeezing
away the liquid, soaking it afresh, and again applying until the
iodine stain has disappeared. Repeat the entire process thrice daily,
but diminish the frequency of the application if tenderness be produced.
In the course of from three or four days to as many weeks the
freckles will either have disappeared entirely or their intensity will be
very greatly diminished. “Summer freckles” yield very speedily to this
treatment.</p>

<h4>ANTI-FRECKLE LOTION.</h4>

<div class="center">

<tr><td class="tal">Orange-flower water, sufficient quantity.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Dissolve the corrosive sublimate in three ounces of the orange-flower
water, add the hydrochloric acid, and set aside. Blanch the bitter
almonds and bruise them in a Wedgwood mortar, adding thereto the
glycerine and using the pestle vigorously; a smooth paste is thus obtained.
Then add gradually about nine ounces of the orange-flower
water, stirring constantly, continuing this operation until a fine, creamy
emulsion is the result. Subject this to violent agitation&mdash;preferably
with the aid of a mechanical egg whisk&mdash;and allow the tincture of benzoin
to fall into it the while drop by drop. Then add the mercurial
solution, filter, and make up the whole to the measure of one imperial
pint (20 ounces) with more orange-flower water.</p>

<p>This preparation is recommended to us by an eminent dermatologist
as being invariably efficacious in the treatment of <i>ephelis</i>, and always
greatly ameliorating <i>lentigo</i>, even if it does not entirely decolorize the
patches in the latter case. A general whitening of the skin is produced
by this lotion without any irritation. It is as well, however, not to
apply it to any abraded surfaces. It has been found far superior in
practice to a preparation&mdash;which it somewhat resembles&mdash;sold at a high
price in Paris under the name of <i>Lait Antiphelique</i>.</p>

than the preceding, which is really only suited for the milder form of
sunburn, while the oleate of copper will remove the more persistent
and obstinate <i>lentigo</i>. It is thus prepared:</p>

<p>This is to be applied in the same manner as the preceding, washing
the surface of the skin, however (after the cold cream), about every
third morning, with a little weak ammonia water, in order to prevent
any inadvertent accumulation of copper.</p>

<p>Several of the preceding are well adapted for the treatment of very
dark-colored and deep-seated examples of <i>lentigo</i>, of which, however,
some seem capable of resisting all treatment of this kind. The only
method of reaching these is by the complete removal of the epidermis
of the part and of the upper portion of the <i>cutis</i> also. A Turkish bath
is often useful as a preliminary for an effort of this kind, which, of
course, needs the application of some disorganizing substance. Permanganate
of potassium answers in this direction, but we find that a
moderately strong solution of Mr. H.&nbsp;B. Condy’s new disinfectant&mdash;per&shy;manga&shy;nate
of aluminum&mdash;is undoubtedly the best of the two for this
purpose. It should be applied several times until the skin has acquired
a uniform brown tint. At from one to twelve hours after this is noticed
it should be removed by a warm and dilute solution (about 8 or 10 per
cent) of hydrochloric acid, to which a little glycerine may be added to
prevent too rapid drying. Still better, however, is nitric acid, which if
“painted” upon a colored spot of this kind first renders it more distinctly
yellow, then orange-brown. In a day or two this becomes a
deeper brown, and more or less disorganized, cracking, either round
the edge, or right across the center, so that it can be readily peeled away.
Freckles removed in this manner seldom crop up again, in that particular
place, at all events. In this connection it is a somewhat curious
fact that whereas <i>dilute</i> nitric acid often caused soreness and irritation
when applied in this manner, a stronger acid does nothing of the kind,
but quietly and quickly “deadens” that portion of the outer covering it
has been applied to, so that in a day or two it can be removed quite
painlessly. What is known as “French nitric acid,” of from 1.330 to
1.350 specific gravity, is very appropriate for this purpose.</p>

<h4>COCAINE AND NITRIC ACID FOR MOLES, ETC.</h4>

<p>The removal of either deep-seated freckles or moles is, as before
hinted, not always an easy task, but nitric acid is perhaps about as good
an agent for the purpose as any other. The mole should be surrounded
by a little “cell” or ring of wax, so that the acid can be applied direct
without fear of disorganizing the adjacent skin. As, however, nitric
acid by itself sometimes occasions a good deal of smarting, etc., when
applied, it is better to avoid this by mixing cocaine with it. The mixture
given below answers the purpose very well indeed:</p>

<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Cocaine</span><span class="amt">6</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;grains.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This should be kept ready for use in a small bottle with a good-fitting
stopper. The end of a glass rod dipped in and then cautiously applied
to the surface of the mole or freckle, the process being repeated once or<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
twice a day, and the unsightly spot has its vitality destroyed without
pain, being then easily and effectually removed.</p>

<h3>Preparation for Red Noses.</h3>

<p>This formula was procured from a friend of the author residing at
Little Rock, Ark. I can vouch for its efficacy in his case, as it removed
the unnatural color in a few days, and he told me that others had tried
it with equally gratifying results. It is translated from a formula of a
young physician, a graduate of Jefferson Medical College:</p>

<div class="center">

<tr><td class="tal">Rose water, sufficient to make 8 ounces.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Mix and apply with a small, soft sponge. The medical works say
little about the red nose. The cause is usually attributed to drinking,
but gluttony, tight lacing, nasal catarrh, chronic enlargement of the
tonsils, exposure to strong sunlight, etc., all contribute to a reddening
of the nasal organ.</p>


<h3>Other Toilet Preparations.</h3>

<p>The following formula, prescribed by the late Dr. Tilbury Fox, is a
very soothing application, and is a great favorite with ladies who have
flushed faces:</p>

<h4>Calamine Face Lotion.</h4>


<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Levigated calamine</span><span class="amt">120</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;grains.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tal">Rose water, sufficient to make 3 ounces.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Be sure and get the white calamine, and not the red. Apply with a
small, soft sponge and allow to dry on, the excess of powder being
lightly dusted off with a soft cloth.</p>

<h4>Lotion for Chapped Hands, Face, and Lips.</h4>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Glycerine</span><span class="amt">3 </span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;drachms.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Mix and apply with a soft sponge while the skin is damp, and wipe
dry with a towel. This is the best preparation of its class.</p>

<h4>Lip Salve.</h4>

<p>For healing and softening the lips, preventing them from cracking,
etc., the following is an elegant preparation:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span></p>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>Melt the petrolatum and wax together and add the tannin while
cooling; add the oils and stir until cold. When it is desired to color
the lips add 20 grains of carmine. This is done by reducing the carmine
to a fine powder in a mortar and rub with a small portion of the salve
until it is thoroughly incorporated, and then mix the remainder gradually.</p>

<h4>Pimple Lotion.</h4>

<p>Experiments with the incubator here given have been made all over
the country. It is one that is in actual use, and has always given satisfaction.
Having secured permission from the originator, we here illustrate
it for the benefit of our readers.</p>

<p>To make this incubator get your tinner to make you a tank 15 inches
wide, 30 inches long, and 12 inches deep, of galvanized iron or zinc, the
iron being preferable. On the top should be a tube 1 inch in diameter
and 8 inches high. In front should be another tube, 9 inches long, to
which should be attached a spigot, as illustrated in Fig.&nbsp;2. Having
made your tank, have what is called the ventilator made, which is a box
with a bottom but no top. The ventilator should be 8 inches deep, and
1 inch smaller all round than the tank, as the tank must rest on inch<span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
boards. In the ventilator should be four or six tin tubes <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> inch in
diameter and 6 inches long. They should extend through the bottom,
so as to admit air from below, and to within 2 inches of the top or a
little less. Now make an egg drawer, which is a frame of wood 3 inches
deep having no top or bottom, except that the front should be boxed off
and filled with sawdust, which is covered over afterward with a piece of
muslin to keep the sawdust from spilling. This box in front of the
drawer exactly fits the opening in Fig.&nbsp;3, when the drawer is in its place.
Of course the egg drawer must be made longer than the tank and ventilator,
in order to allow for this space which it fills in the opening, which
is the packing all around the incubator. The bottom of the egg drawer
should be made by nailing a few slats lengthwise to the under side, or
rather, fitting them in nicely, and over the slats in the inside of the
drawer a piece of thick, strong muslin should be tightly drawn. On
this muslin the eggs are placed, in the same position as if laid in a hen’s
nest, and it allows the air to pass through to the eggs for ventilation.<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
The eggs can be turned by hand, marked for designation, or an egg
turner may be made by fastening slats crosswise to one on each side
running lengthwise, something like a window lattice, and when the eggs
are placed between these slots by merely pushing the frame the eggs will
turn over, exactly on the same principle that an egg will roll when it is
pushed by a block, a book, or anything else; but we believe the method
is patented, and do not advise infringement.</p>

<p>Having prepared the tank, let it be covered with a box, but the box
must not have any bottom. This is to protect the tank against pressure
of water on the sides, and to assist in retaining heat. Such being done,
place your ventilator first, egg drawer next, and tank last. Now place
a support under the tank and the box, or have them rest on rods, and as
the weight of water will be great in the center, the iron rods should be
placed crosswise under the tank every 6 inches. Now fasten the three
apartments (ventilator, egg drawer, and tank) together, with boards<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
nailed to the sides and back and front (of course leaving the opening
for the egg drawer), care being taken to drive no nails in the egg
drawer, as it must move in and out, and should have a strong strip to
rest on for that purpose. Having completed these preparations make a
larger box to go over all three, so that there will be a space on the sides,
back, front, and on top; but as the ventilator must be filled with sawdust
to within 1 inch of the top of the tubes, it serves for the bottom
packing. Make the outer box so that there will be room for filling all
around the inside box with sawdust, and also on top, being careful to
let the tube for pouring in the water come through, as also the spigot in
front. About 4 inches or so thickness of sawdust is sufficient, according
to preference. The front of the incubator must be packed also, but
an idea of how it should be done may be learned by observing the open<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>ing
in Fig.&nbsp;3, which is so constructed that the box in front of the egg
drawer (Fig.&nbsp;4) exactly fits into it, and completes the packing when the
drawer is shut. The incubator should be raised from the floor about an
inch, when completed, to allow the air to pass under and thence into
the ventilator tubes.</p>

<p>The incubator being complete, the tank is filled with boiling water.
It must remain untouched for twenty-four hours, as it requires time
during which to heat completely through. As it will heat slowly, it
will also cool slowly. Let it cool down to 120 deg., and then put in the
eggs, or, what is better, run it without eggs for a day or two in order to
learn it and notice its variation. When the eggs are put in, the drawer
will cool down some. All that is required then is to add about a bucket
or so of water once or twice a day, but be careful about endeavoring to
get up heat suddenly, as the heat does not rise for five hours after the
additional bucket of water is added. The tank radiates the heat down
on the eggs, there being nothing between the iron bottom of the tank
and the eggs, for the wood over and around the tank does not extend
across the bottom of the tank. The cool air comes from below in the
ventilator pipes, passing through the muslin bottom of the egg drawer
to the eggs. The 15×30-inch tank incubator holds 100 eggs if turned by
hand, but less if the eggs are placed between slats. Lay the eggs in the
same [way] as in a nest&mdash;promiscuously.</p>


<h4>DIRECTIONS.</h4>

<p>Keep the heat inside the egg drawer as near 103 deg. as possible; the
third week at 104 deg. Avoid opening the egg drawer frequently, as it
allows too much escape of heat. <i>Be sure your thermometer records
correctly</i>, as half the failures are due to incorrect thermometers, and
not one in twenty is correct. Place the bulb of the thermometer even
with the top of the eggs, that is, when the thermometer is lying down in
the drawer. The upper end should be slightly raised, so as to allow the
mercury to rise, but the bulb and eggs should be of the same heat, as
the figures record the heat in the bulb and not in the tube. Keep a pie
pan filled with water in the ventilator for moisture and keep two or
three moist sponges in the egg drawer, displacing a few eggs for the
purpose. Turn the eggs half way round twice a day at regular intervals.
Let the eggs cool down for fifteen minutes once every day, but do not
let them cool lower than 70 deg. No sprinkling is required if the
sponges are kept moist. If the heat gets up to 110 deg. or as low as 60
deg. for a little while it is not necessarily fatal. Too much heat is more
prevalent than too little. A week’s practice in operating the incubator
will surprise one how simple the work is. The tank will be troublesome
to fill at first, but the matter will be easy after it is done, as it can
be kept hot. Heat the water in two or more boilers, as a large quantity
will be required, and pour it in through the tube on top of the incubator
boiling hot, using a funnel in the tube for the purpose. Just at the
time of hatching out do not be tempted to frequently open the drawer.
Cold draughts are fatal. Patience must be exercised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span></p>


<h4>BROODERS.</h4>

<p>An excellent brooder may be made with a tank of hot water, covered
well, the same as the incubator. A piece of muslin or woolen cloth
should be next the bottom to prevent burning the chicks. Keep the
heat among the chicks at about 90 deg. Let the tank rest on inch boards
with no opening under it, but in front; a fringe should hang in front
for the chicks to run in and out under the tank. A little yard may be
constructed of glass sash, something like a hot-bed. Feed the chicks
four or five times a day, at first on hard-boiled eggs, chopped fine, giving
them also a little milk, fine screenings, and millet seed. After they are
a week old feed anything they can eat, but never feed meal in a raw
state, as it should be scalded first. Keep a little sand, fine gravel, and
bone-meal within reach of them all the time, and see that they are always
dry, clean, and warm. Do not crowd them, as the fewer the number
together the better, and never have different ages together.</p>

<p>This incubator will hatch chicks, ducks, turkeys, or guineas, and we
see no reason why it should not hatch the egg of the ostrich or anything
else as well. Chicks hatched by in&shy;cu&shy;ba&shy;tors, if rightly cared for, do
better than with hens, and are stronger and more vigorous.</p>

<p>We have endeavored here to embody all the answers to questions that
we suppose may be asked. Should you be in doubt, read the directions
carefully again. We trust that with the help of our illustrations our
readers will have no difficulties in the way.&mdash;<i>The Poultry Keeper.</i></p>


<h3>A Cheap Charcoal Stove.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="150" height="227" alt="" />
</div>

<p>I saw the other day at a friend’s house one of the simplest and most
effective stoves for a small conservatory it is possible to imagine. It
was composed of three <span class="nowrap">12-inch</span> ordinary flower
pots. The hole at the bottom of the lowest was
covered with a small pot, into the sides of which
had been bored a number of holes. The pot was
then three parts filled with charcoal, and lighted
from the top. This is the furnace. It is covered
by pots Nos. 2 and 3, and a light tin funnel and
chimney carry off the vapor. The draught is
maintained by placing the apparatus on a couple
of bricks, and regulated by closing the intervening
space with mud, leaving only a sufficient
aperture to keep the fire burning. This improvised
stove will burn without attention for
twenty-four hours, and it is amazing what a
great amount of heat is given off from so small
a surface.&mdash;<i>S.&nbsp;J., in the Gardener’s Chronicle.</i></p>

<h3>Preservative Compounds.</h3>

<p>Within a few years some valuable methods of keeping meats, fish,
oysters, fruits, fruit juices, milk, butter, etc., in a healthful, nutritious,
and palatable condition for a considerable time past the ordinary period
of their decay have been discovered. In the following treatise we give
the results of the most patient research in securing all the latest and
most valuable information in regard to this important subject.</p>

<p>We will not deal with processes which necessitate complicated apparatus
or which require almost impossible chemical combinations,
but we will explain inventions which have un&shy;doubt&shy;ed value combined
with as much simplicity in the preparation as the circumstances will
permit.</p>

<p>Of all the anti-septic agents used for the purposes mentioned boracic
acid is the favorite, and salicylic acid next in choice. Various other
anti-septic agents are used and combined in different ways, according
to the results of experiments. They are applied either by immersion,
coating, injecting, vapors, etc., according to specified instructions.</p>

<p>Prof. Frederic S. Barff of Kilburn, England, it seems was the first
to combine boracic acid with glycerine, and to produce a preservative
compound known as boroglyceride, which is soluble in water and
alcohol. As boracic acid is but slightly soluble in water and other
common solvents this combination with glycerine&mdash;which is also a useful
agent in arresting the growth of germs&mdash;is peculiarly valuable. It
is tasteless and inodorous and imparts no dis&shy;agree&shy;able taste or odor to
the substance being treated. Solutions of the compound may be applied
to the preservation of all organic substances, either animal or vegetable.
The process was patented in England in 1881 and in the United
States in 1882.</p>

<p>To prepare boroglyceride, glycerine is heated to near its boiling
point and boracic acid added until it ceases to be dissolved, the proportions
being about 92 parts by weight of glycerine to 62 parts by weight
of boracic acid in chrystals. Maintain the mixture to a temperature of
about 200 deg. centigrade as long as water is given off. When the mass
cools it becomes a yellowish, transparent, glacial substance, tough and
deliquescent. This dissolves in water, but when boiled in large quantities
of the same it is decomposed into glycerine and boracic acid. In
order to employ the compound prepare a solution either in water,
alcohol, or other suitable solvent and immerse in or impregnate with
such solutions the organic substances to be operated upon. Solutions
may be prepared of various degrees of strength, but it has been found
that a solution consisting of 1 part by weight of the compound and 40
parts by weight of water will give good results; but other desired proportions
may be adopted.</p>

<p>Prof. Barff, the inventor of the boroglyceride process, read a paper
before the Royal Society of Arts, London, in regard to his method of
preserving food. The date of the reading is not at hand, but it is sup<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>posed
to be slightly prior to May 13, 1882, on which date it was printed
in the <i>Scientific American Supplement</i>. Although quite lengthy the
paper contains so much interesting data and light upon the subject that
we reproduce it almost entirely, together with remarks by other eminent
gentlemen who were present at the meeting:</p>

<p>“This evening I have on the table specimens of food which have been
kept for longer or shorter periods, as they are intended to illustrate
various applications of this preserving material. As you know oysters
are imported very largely in tins. They are cooked at a high temperature
and hermetically sealed. The high temperature to which they are
exposed necessarily causes a loss of flavor, and it is generally remarked
that tinned oysters are not a success. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I have oysters on the
table which were opened on the 3d of December in last year. I will ask
you to taste them and see in what condition they are, and I would also
remind you that they have not been kept in hermetically sealed tins, but
simply in corked or stoppered bottles; hence this method of preserving
oysters is cheaper than the other, and I maintain that it is more effective,
because their natural and fresh flavor is preserved. I am informed by a
friend in Jamaica that he has sent me some Jamaica oysters and other
things&mdash;I trust they will be here in time for me to submit them to you
this evening.</p>

<p>“Another substance, the perfect preservation of which is very important,
is cream, both for home use and for exportation. Cream in
London costs from four to five shillings per quart; it can be bought in
country places for two shillings, and even for less. This preservative substance
will keep cream for months perfectly good and sweet, having its
full flavor; so that it would be quite possible to send it in quantities
from the country, and its sale need not be pressed as it need not be used
immediately. I have regularly every week, except during the holidays,
brought with me from Beaumont College, near Windsor, where I lecture,
a quart of cream treated with one ounce of the boroglyceride; it has
always kept perfectly good even in the hottest weather. I have done
this for a year and a half; a near relative has taken the greater part of
this regularly for the time stated, and this proves conclusively that there
is nothing at all injurious to health in the compound. I see a gentleman
present here to-night who is connected with that college as a professor
of natural science, and he will, in the discussion, be able to give
you very valuable information as to the material and as to its perfect
wholesomeness. Last month I sent some cream to the Rev. J. Ryan, a
Jesuit priest in Jamaica, and I have received a letter from him, from
which I will read you an extract:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="address1">‘26 <span class="smcap">North Street, Kingston, Jamaica,</span></p>
<p class="address2 lh07">‘February 24, 1882.</p>
<p>‘The cream which you sent was used by eight of us in coffee, and was
pronounced to be wonderfully good. Next morning it was taken in
preference to a beaten egg, by the captain of H.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;S. Tenedos, to his
coffee.’</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span></p>

<p>“Last year I sent some Devonshire clotted cream, which I prepared
myself, to Zanzibar, on the east coast of Africa. The climate here is
very hot; fresh food will only keep a few hours. This cream had to pass
through the hot climate of the Red Sea. I will read an extract from a
letter written by a lady who received the cream:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="address1">‘<span class="smcap">Universities Mission To Central Africa,</span></p>
<p class="address2 lh07">‘<span class="smcap">Mbweni, Zanzibar</span>, March 8, 1881.</p>
<p>‘The Devonshire cream you sent us was quite a success. I received it
last night. Fortunately the Bishop and Miss A&mdash;&mdash; came to Mbweni,
to-day, so we had it for dinner. That I might have everything correct
I opened a pot of raspberry jam which we had from London a long time
ago. The Bishop said it had kept perfectly, but had not quite the rich
flavor that it has when quite fresh; he has been used to it in Devonshire.
Every one pronounced it most excellent. We sent some in to Mrs.
<span class="nowrap">H&mdash;&mdash;</span>, and were surprised at her sending for more, for she seldom
eats half anything we send her. She did not know what it was, but she
said she had never had anything here she enjoyed so much.’</p></div>

<p>“A year ago I sent some cream from Beaumont College dairy to the
Rev. Thomas Porter, the head of the Jesuit Mission in the West Indies.
He states that the cream was as good as any he had eaten at home, that
he gave it to several strangers to eat, and that they would not believe
that it came from England. These experiments and these testimonies
prove conclusively that this compound will preserve cream. I shall
this evening show you specimens. It is easy to send cream in good
condition to the tropics. A great objection to condensed milk is that
it is always too sweet. The boroglyceride will preserve condensed milk,
and will give it no flavor at all. My friend, the Rev. Thomas Porter,
sent me some articles preserved with the material which I sent him
from England. They arrived about June in last year. Some raw, fresh
turtle came quite fresh. It was cooked and eaten by several persons, who
said it was quite fresh and good, and had the flavor of fresh turtle. At
my own house I had turtle cutlets fried; they were perfectly good, and
tasted like turtle. Another article which Father Porter sent me was an
uncooked Jamaica pigeon; it was roasted at Beaumont College. I
divided it and brought half of it home It was tasted by twelve people,
who all pronounced that it was perfectly good, and had the true pigeon
flavor. In the same parcel came some green sugar-cane, fresh tamarinds
taken direct from the tree, fresh limes, and the juices of two
different fruits. All were fresh, and were tasted by gentlemen who had
lived in Jamaica, who all declared that they had all their own peculiar
flavors. On the 3d of September, 1881, another box was sent me from
Jamaica, containing sugar-cane, guavas, fresh ginger, and turtle; the
turtle had come to grief, because it was not properly treated on the
other side; the cane, guavas, and fresh ginger have been tasted by those
who have lived in Jamaica, and have been pronounced to have their
true flavors.</p>

<p>“Ordinary milk cannot be kept good for a long time, especially in hot
weather. If milk were concentrated in this country, and heated with<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
the boroglyceride, carriage would be saved, and the milk might be kept
good and fresh for a fortnight and more; all it would require would be
to reduce it again to its original strength. If fresh milk be treated with
this preservative it can be set for cream for several days, even in hot
weather. The cream which rises will keep, and the skim-milk will remain
sweet for several weeks; this I have tried in the dairy at Beaumont
College. From the cream so prepared butter was made, and was kept
for several weeks without a particle of salt, and was eaten by members
of the college. I also wish to show another method by which meat can
be preserved and cheaply transported. In South America, about Buenos
Ayres and the River Platte, many cattle are killed simply for the hides
and fat; the flesh is thrown away. Now, if this flesh were cut up in
small pieces, and put into the preserving liquid for a night, it would,
even in that hot climate, keep good for some time. It could then in a
few hours be dried in the sun, packed in casks, and sent to this or to
other countries. I have a specimen of beef treated in this way. It was
put into the solution on Jan.&nbsp;19, 1882, dried Feb.&nbsp;1, and has lately, within
a few days, been boiled, and here is the resulting beef tea, which has not
in any way been flavored. I have also small quantities of beef juice
here preserved in bottles. The juice was expressed and has been kept
raw. Raw beef and mutton juice is recommended by medical men in
many conditions of the digestive system. I administered it to a near
relation for six weeks, and the juice was preserved good by my material.
In the case referred to the effect was very satisfactory. It appears to
me to be a most important matter that soup meat, and meat for potting
and stewing, should be sent to this country in the way I propose. The
supply would be large, the prices low, and the profits highly satisfactory,
and it would greatly relieve the meat market, because a very large quantity
of fresh meat which is now used for soup could be employed in
other ways. It has been remarked to me: ‘But would you get people to
use it?’ I think, to begin with, that if proprietors of hotels and heads
of large public institutions, workhouses, and hospitals could be shown
that for half the cost they could have equally good soup and soup stock,
they would willingly use it, and from thence it would come into private
use. I have specimens to show the effect of boroglyceride on fish. Here
are sprats which have been kept for a year; they are dry, but perfectly
good and eatable; also some preserved fresh since Jan.&nbsp;13, 1882. You
will be able to judge of their appearance and flavor. I have also herrings
and a piece of skate which have been preserved for the same time.
If fishmongers had a tank of this solution they could, at the end of the
day, put their fish in it, and take them out when required. Bloaters, when
lightly cured in hot weather, do not keep good many days; if a small
quantity of this stuff was used with the salt, they would keep good for
months. The same may be said of smoked salmon. That which is very
salt costs 9d. per pound, but the mild cured kinds cost 3s.&nbsp;6d. to 4s. per
pound. All could be mildly cured if this material was used with the
other curing substances. As an adjunct in curing mild hams and bacon<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
it would be of great use, for these, when cured lightly, would not go
bad, as they often do in the summer time. What I have said as to the
temporary preservation of fish by fishmongers applies equally to the
preservation of meat and fowls by butchers and poulterers.</p>

<p>“It is justly complained of that the Australian cooked meat is overcooked.
If it were for a short time dropped in this preservative solution
it would keep perfectly well after being lightly cooked, even underdone.
I have a piece of beef which was dipped Feb. 28 and boiled on
March 9. It has been left in its own liquid, it was not flavored, and no
salt was added. Here, too, is a vast field for the application of the
process. Here is also lobster which was taken out of the shell Feb. 1,
and here are two lobsters in their shell which were immersed on the
same day.</p>

<p>“I now wish to draw your attention to a parcel from Jamaica, which
has just arrived, and from which I am able, I am happy to say, to show
you specimens which must be of interest. In a jar on the table is some
fresh turtle, which I had simply cooked. I thought it better so to present
it to you rather than raw. There is also a Jamaica pigeon, also
just cooked here, and a <i>vol au vent</i>, which I have had made from oysters
which were sent open in the preserving stuff from Jamaica. These
specimens will prove conclusively that food sent from a tropical
climate retains its freshness and delicate flavor. I have reserved one of
the pigeons raw, that you may see in what state it arrived. Some mutton
was shipped to me from the Falkland Islands at the beginning of
last August; a piece of it is uncooked on the table. I have also had a
piece stewed, which you will be able to taste; this has of course passed
the tropics. Through the kindness of my friend Mr. Haffenden of the
‘Andaluzia,’ in the Strand, who owns vineyards in the southwest of
Spain, I can show you some perfectly fresh sardines which he had placed
in the preserving fluid several months ago in Spain, and which he
brought with him. You will yourselves judge of their condition; I will
only remark that they have the peculiar fragrance of that delicate fish,
and will it not be a boon to have a supply of this fresh delicacy at a
moderate cost?</p>

<p>“You will also see, and I hope taste, a pigeon pie. The pigeons and
the steak have been preserved raw in stoppered bottles since the 21st of
last November and the eggs since the 4th of July, 1881. I will also call
your attention to a tongue which I myself placed in the solution Feb. 9
in this year, with some garlic, sugar, and juniper berries, my object being
to show that salt can, if desired, be dispensed with. You will doubtless
find that it will require salt; but you will readily infer that hams,
tongues, etc., can be made just as salt as one pleases, and will yet keep
perfectly sweet, in fact sounder, than those cured only with salt. This
tongue was boiled out of pickle. I exhibit two shoulders of mutton,
one cooked, the other raw; they are from sheep killed Jan. 10, 1882.
Also a piece of beef preserved on the same day; this when you have inspected
it shall be cut in slices and broiled. You will see some sausages,<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
both cooked and uncooked; they were made for me by Mr. Bowron,
poulterer, of Paddington, early in July last, before I went to Carlsbad.
I took some with me to that place, and they were there eaten and pronounced
good. These are some of the same lot; they were made as follows:
The meat was chopped, put into the preserving fluid for one
night, and then mixed with the other material in the ordinary way.
They have been kept since in an earthenware jar; they have, therefore,
been made more than nine months. I may remark that the bread in
these sausages was not treated, and therefore it has become slightly
sour, but the pork has kept perfectly fresh. I have also some other
sausages which I bought Jan. 12, and at once preserved; these having
been steeped, the bread has not turned in the slightest degree sour.</p>

<p>“Mock turtle soup, bought ready made from a confectioner’s shop in
Oxford street, Jan. 25, treated with the preservative stuff, has remained
quite good and unchanged in flavor.</p>

<p>“There is also a specimen of gravy soup made in October last, and
some vermicelli soup made about three weeks ago. The preservative
action of boroglyceride in cooked foods is, it seems to me, of great importance
to hotel-keepers, confectioners, and restaurant proprietors, as
it will enable them to buy large stocks when certain articles are cheap,
and from the specimen I show of cooked beef you see it remains quite
moist, as it can be kept, without getting sour, in its own gravy and under
a layer of its own fat. To prove that articles can be kept and dried
without losing their flavor, I had some partridges treated and dried
last February twelvemonth, and I exhibit some soup made from two of
these birds. The other articles on the table are one raw and one roast
fowl, bought Jan. 17; one raw and one roast pheasant, bought Feb. 5; one
rabbit boiled, bought Jan. 17. There are also from Jamaica a green
lime, some fresh tamarinds, and some pieces of fresh ginger. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the patient hearing you have
given me.”</p>

<h4>DISCUSSION.</h4>

<p>The Chairman said the paper was marked by the clear and philosophic
way in which the subject was treated, and before inviting discussion
upon it he would mention shortly his own experience of the
process, the only interest of which was that it was quite independent of
Prof. Barff. When he was asked to take the chair he communicated
with Mr. Barff, and inquired what the process was. Mr. Barff kindly
sent him a specimen of this substance, which he melted, and put some
of it into one-half of a pint of cream. The other half very soon turned
sour, and had to be thrown away, but that to which the substance was
added was perfectly fresh that morning. He was confirmed in the
opinion of its freshness by the cook, though she said there was a very
slight tartness perceptible, by which she could distinguish it from fresh
cream. He had also tried another experiment on meat which was
chopped very fine, and divided into two parts; to one part he added
merely tepid water, to the other, tepid water to which one-sixteenth<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
of its bulk of this compound had been added. This was left on the
meat for eighteen hours, and then filtered off through muslin. Several
days ago the portion which had no preservative was very offensive, but
the other portion was that morning perfectly free from any odor whatever.</p>

<p>The Rev. J.&nbsp;L. Dobson said he had had the pleasure of being associated
with Mr. Barff in most of the experiments he had detailed, and
might therefore anticipate his reply to one or two points raised by Dr.
Graham. An experiment which was tried for some time in a large
school would answer the question of wholesomeness. At the Beaumont
College, Windsor, there was a large staff of teachers and over 200 pupils,
and during the hot weather of last summer the dairymaid was very much
annoyed at the milk turning sour, and applied to him to see if he could
do anything to counteract it. He handed her some 14 or 15&nbsp;lbs. of this
material and during the whole of the hot weather and well on into September
it was constantly used, and the milk was preserved; but the
method was not detected by any one, either by the younger members or
by those who might be expected to be more critical. No ill effects were
observed by the medical officer or by individuals. From his own experience
he thought the aroma was very well preserved throughout.
For instance, in oysters which had been preserved over three months
there was the characteristic aroma of the fresh oyster; mutton could be
easily distinguished from beef, and the peculiar smell of the turtle was
also very distinct. They had not yet tried beer with so much fullness as
other articles, but about nine months ago a small quantity was treated
and left exposed to the air, with only a loose stopper of cotton wool.
It did not grow cloudy in the ordinary way, but owing to the severity of
the experiment, and perhaps to not sufficiently treating it, after four
months it lost all flavor, became extremely flat, and a slight fungus appeared.</p>

<p>Dr. Thudichum had listened with great pleasure to the paper, and
had no doubt if the application of the invention could be effected on a
large scale it would be very useful. He had some experience with regard
to a portion of the ingredients used, viz.: boracic acid, though he
had none of this beautiful new compound. It might not be known to
the meeting that boracic acid had been used for a great many years for
preserving food, and in fact many of them in summer time had their
milk well dosed with it. It had been sold to milkmen in London for
years under the name of “aseptin.” He had tested it in 1865 and found
a great many of those effects which Mr. Barff described. For instance
eggs were beautifully preserved, and steak immersed in the solution did
not become either mouldy or decomposed, but on the contrary appeared
to retain its flavor. A variety of other things, such as cheese and cream,
were for a long time preserved by this application of aseptin. He hoped
the addition of the glycerine would increase the power and prevent
some drawbacks which would otherwise stand in the way of boracic
acid alone as a preservative of raw or cooked meat.</p>

<p>Prof. Barff, in reply to the various questions which had been asked,<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
said he had used salicylic acid and had found it useful in preserving
food, but for several reasons discontinued further investigations, one
being on the score of its unwholesomeness, and he found that his views
on that point had been borne out by the action taken by the French
Government. Dr. Graham had asked him about flavor; he had given
Dr. Graham a few days ago some specimens of preserved fish, which he
said had lost their flavor, but that would not be found to be the case
with the box of sardines. The herrings had been kept in an open vessel
exposed to the air ever since the day they were put into the liquid, and
therefore it was not surprising that they had lost their flavor. If they
would try any of the things which had been tinned, not soldered up, but
such as the Jamaica pigeons, which were in a common corked bottle, it
would be found that the aroma and flavor were retained. The only
thing requisite was to keep the vessel so as to exclude the air, as you
would with tea or coffee. Dr. Thudichum made some very interesting
remarks which there was not time to refer to at length, if he were competent
to do so, but not being a medical man he could not enter into
medical questions. As to the wholesomeness of the compound, however,
he might say that he had taken large quantities of it himself and
it had never done him any harm; and a near relative had taken an ounce
per week regularly for a year and a half, without any ill effect&mdash;a person,
too, not very strong or of good digestive powers. The boys and teachers
of Beaumont College drank milk preserved with it without distinguishing
the taste or suffering any ill effects. He knew there were medical
opinions in favor of boracic acid, and one physician he was acquainted
with used it as a medicine. If it were at all unwholesome he certainly
should not recommend it, but he did not think there was the slightest
fear. As to boron getting into the system, it was not boron which was
used, but oxide of boron; but even if it did&mdash;and he should not be surprised
if traces of boron were found in the excreta&mdash;it did not follow
that any harm was done. There were many things which went through
the system without injury; for instance, silica, of which most people
took a great deal in the twenty-four hours. As to the cost of the process
the cost per gallon, as far as he could tell&mdash;he could not tell exactly&mdash;would
be under 1s.&mdash;perhaps 8d. or 9d.&mdash;and a gallon would affect an
enormous quantity. Most of the articles on the table were put into one
pan of solution, and the cost of the whole stuff was about <span class="nowrap">9 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span>d. Should
the process be adopted commercially experiments as to the cost would
be most carefully made and the results published. A joint of any size
could be soaked; the only thing was to give it plenty of time. You
might soak a piece of beef of twenty pounds, forty pounds, or fifty
pounds; or you might use an injecting syringe, such as butchers employed
for salting meat quickly, and the meat so treated would keep for
a week or a fortnight perfectly good, but he did not think it would keep
well enough to pass under a tropical sun. In order to do that you must
inject by the aorta, by means of a force pump, so as to send the liquid
into all the interstices of the flesh. As to the proportions, 1 in 20 was
the strongest he used, and 1 in 60 the weakest; for preserving meat 1 in<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
50 answered perfectly well&mdash;1&nbsp;lb. of the compound added to 50&nbsp;lbs. of
water. The bottle should be put before the fire until melted, and then
poured into hot water, and it would dissolve. With regard to preserving
morbid specimens he thought it would answer perfectly well. He
had had some practice in morbid anatomy, and he might say that, for
the injection of bodies to be used for anatomical purposes it would
keep them perfectly sweet. It should be injected by the aorta in the
usual way before injecting with the red wax. In reply to Mr. Dipnall
he would say that the compound penetrated right through into the innermost
parts of the meat. If you had an earthen pan and put into it 1&nbsp;lb. of this and 50&nbsp;lbs. of water, and placed in it a joint which came
home on the Saturday night in hot weather, you could take it out the
next day and it would keep perfectly for a fortnight. Of course it took
time to penetrate into the meat, but the first superficial penetration
stopped the injurious effects of germs which set up putrefaction. Another
important fact was this: if you had a roast leg of lamb, perfectly
good, but did not eat it all, and put it away in hot weather, it would
turn sour, but if it had been treated in this way it would not; it would
keep for six months without going sour. By adding a small quantity
from time to time, which you could only learn by experience, the bath
would keep perfectly fresh and effective, though it would be found after
a time to get rather dark colored. That arose from the juice of the
meat, and the advantage of this process was that you need not throw it
away, as you must brine, but could boil it down into very good soup.
In conclusion he would only ask his hearers to read the paper and discussion
carefully when published, and he was sure any one would be
able to carry out the process.</p>

<p>The Chairman, in proposing a hearty vote of thanks to Prof. Barff,
said the process he had described was remarkable for its great simplicity
and the ease with which it could be carried out. Any cook could
readily apply it.</p>

<p>The vote of thanks was carried unanimously.</p>


<h4>An Improved Boracic Acid-Glycerine Compound.</h4>

<p>The following is the invention of an American, William S. Fickett
of Rochester, N.&nbsp;Y., and is an improved process of combining boracic
acid with glycerine for preservative purposes. (Patent No. 285,350.)</p>

<p>“My invention consists in a new mode of producing a new preservative
compound from boracic acid and glycerine, as hereinafter described.
Heretofore by one <span class="nowrap">method<sup>*</sup></span> such a compound has been produced from
these ingredients by heating glycerine to near its boiling point and adding
boracic acid until it ceases to be dissolved, and maintaining that
mixture to a temperature of 200 deg. centigrade as long as water is given
off, etc.</p>

<p class="ml2em">* Doubtless the Barff process&mdash;[author].</p>

<p>“Now my process consists in taking equal quantities of glycerine and
crystallized boracic acid, placing the same in a closed or sealed vessel,<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
and then applying heat at about 300 deg. Fahrenheit for about two hours,
which causes the boracic acid to dissolve and blend with the glycerine.
On cooling it forms without loss of weight into on opalescent semi-solid,
freely soluble in cold water, entirely devoid of bitter or metallic
taste, and communicating no objectionable taste to butter or like delicate
foods. When thus produced it is an unfailing preventive of fermentation
and decay in animal and vegetable matter or fluid compounds.”</p>

<p>The following is a different process of using boracic acid, and explains
itself:</p>

<p>James Howard, Philadelphia, Pa.; composition for preserving foods.
(Patent No. 276,246.)</p>

<p>“I have discovered a method of obtaining a chemical compound of
boracic acid for the production of which neither solution nor the employment
of heat is necessary, the salt being formed by the union of the
component substances in a dry state, so that the difficulties of solution
and of loss through volitization is avoided. Moreover the compound has
anti-septic properties distinct from those of the acid, due to one of the
other elements thereof, and is tasteless.</p>

<p>“I take preferably not less than 5 parts by weight of pure boracic
acid in crystals, and add thereto 1 part of pure phosphate of soda. The
ingredients are mixed together dry, in a mill or other suitable grinding
apparatus, and as the chemical reaction between them progresses the
whole, or practically the whole, of the acid crystals lose their structure,
and the mass can be ground until it assumes a pasty or doughy condition.
The result is boro-phosphate of soda, containing more or less
free boracic acid, according to the excess thereof used above the proportions
given. The moisture yielded by the chemical reaction is
evaporated at the ordinary temperature by exposure to the air without
loss of boracic acid, and the dry amorphous salt thus produced is readily
ground. It may be used either as a dry powder or may be dissolved
in water and applied in the usual modes to the substances to be preserved.
If desired other substances, such as salt and saltpeter, may be
added to the boro-phosphate compound, and the whole mixed thoroughly
by regrinding.”</p>

<h4>Preservation of Butter, Lard, Etc.</h4>

<p>The following process is the invention of Mr. William Pitt Clotworthy.
(Patent No. 284,184.)</p>

<p>The process consists of incorporating with the fat, which may consist
of butter, lard, or other grease, a sufficient amount of paraffine.
Paraffine is non-oxidizable, without taste or odor, and, as the inventor
claims, it is perfectly harmless when used in this manner, just as beeswax
is swallowed with honey, although not in such large proportion.
Tons of paraffine are manufactured yearly into chewing gum and chewed
harmlessly by thousands.</p>

<p>In preserving butter the process is as follows: Take 1 ounce of fresh
unsalted butter and incorporate with it 1 ounce of paraffine, and thus<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
form a jelly, and then thoroughly mix this amount of jelly with 1 pound
of butter.</p>

<p>In preserving lard combine the paraffine as follows: When the lard
is ready to be drawn off from the rendering kettles, and while still hot,
add 1 ounce of paraffine to each pound of lard and stir the mass thoroughly.</p>

<h4>Compound for Preserving Food.</h4>

<p>Theodore L. Corwin of Marathon, N.&nbsp;Y., has invented the following.
(Patent No. 253,983):</p>

<p>The invention relates to the class of compounds used to preserve in a
healthful state such articles of food as meats, fish, milk, eggs, butter,
oysters, cider, and also to be used as a disinfectant and to arrest putrefaction.</p>

<p>“I take of nitrate of potassium, of salicylic acid, and of chloride of
sodium, each 1 ounce. These should all be in powder and dissolved in 1
quart of water. Then add 1 drachm of hydro&shy;chloric acid previously
diluted with 1 ounce of water. To preserve meat immerse for twenty
minutes in the hot solution, after which let it drain for one hour; then
pack in a well-closed vessel. For the preservation of fish use the same
as for meat, only the solution should be allowed to become cold before
using. To keep oysters stir into them 3 ounces of the solution (cold) to
each gallon of oysters. Cider will be kept sweet if there is added to
each barrel 1 quart of the solution immediately after the cider comes
from the press. Milk to be kept sweet should have the powder first
named, viz.: nitrate of potassium, salicylic acid, and chloride of sodium,
each 1 ounce, added to every 16 gallons. As a disinfectant the solution
should be sprinkled freely around the place or places to be disinfected.
To prevent putrefaction the solution should be copiously applied to the
object treated.”</p>

<h4>Fruit-Juice Preservatives.</h4>

<p>An Ohio inventor has patented a process for preserving fruit juices
such as cider, wine, etc., which he says, if treated according to his directions,
will keep unchanged for years:</p>

<p>“The juice is taken before fermentation takes place and boiled, all
scum is carefully skimmed off, and then the liquid, while still hot, is
filtered through a compound of partially pulverized charcoal, crushed
mustard seed, and ground sassafras root. The filter should be covered
with fine woven wire, outside of which should be fastened a flannel
cloth to catch all escaping sediment. To every gallon of juice to be
filtered there is placed in the filter 2 ounces of charcoal, 2 scruples of
crushed mustard seed, and 6 drachms of ground sassafras root. After
filtering it is again boiled, and if any scum or impurities appear on the
surface they are removed, when the juice is to be bottled, corked tightly,
and should be left for one year.”</p>

<p>Schaumberg &amp; Dillon’s method of preserving fruit juices consists in
bottling and sealing the juices, and then heating the bottles to 170 deg.<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
Fahrenheit for thirty-five minutes. The juices are put in bottles and
are immediately corked and wired securely, and then submerged in a
water bath to a depth of about 1 inch above the bottles.</p>

<p>The advantages of this process are that the fruit juices will remain
sweet indefinitely, will not ferment, and are free from all deleterious
matter.</p>

<h4>Smoke or Vapor Preserving Compound.</h4>

<p>Rebecca A. McDaniel of Burr Oaks, Ia., has patented the following,
which is one of quite a number of this class of preservative processes:</p>

<p>“In preserving different articles, such as fruits, meats, and other
edibles, I subject them for a proper time&mdash;differing with different articles&mdash;to
the fumes arising from burning the compound. This may be
accomplished by confining the articles to be treated in a chamber in
which the compound is being burned.</p>

<h5>COMPOSITION.</h5>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Salicylic acid</span><span class="amt">1 </span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounce.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>“This compound well mixed will burn slowly and generate fumes or
vapor which have a peculiar action in the preservation of fruits, butter,
milk, pies, bread, eggs, and all kinds of cooked or uncooked food. In
treating meats add nitrate of potash, 4 ounces.</p>

<p>“Treatment: Provide a box or other chamber with shelves upon which
the articles to be treated may be placed. Within the chamber, properly
closed, I burn a suitable quantity of the compound, allowing the fumes
to bathe the articles to be treated. The compound is of a quality that
will burn slowly by reason of its peculiar composition, and it may be
burned with fuel other than it contains.”</p>


<h4>Salicylic Acid as a Preservative.</h4>

<p>Salicylic acid, aside from its remedial value, is used largely as a preservative,
either in a dry state or in the form of a solution in water or
alcohol. Salicylic acid is a white, dry, crystalline powder, devoid of
smell or taste, undergoes no change when kept in store, and is neither
inflammable nor volatile. It can be procured in almost any drug store,
and since 1874 a new process in its manufacture has cheapened it in
price and placed it within the reach of all.</p>

<p>Medical authorities agree in considering the daily consumption of 1
gramme as being not only perfectly inoffensive, but decidedly beneficial
to health. An individual living on a salicylated diet would not absorb
so much of the salicylic acid per diem as that which is prescribed to be
taken for the prevention of epidemics and other ailments, such as gout,
rheumatism, catarrhal affections, etc.</p>

<p>The proportions in which salicylic acid dissolves are:<br />
<span class="ml2em">One part by weight in 300 to 500 parts of cold water.</span><br />
<span class="ml2em">One part by weight in 18 to 20 parts of hot water.</span><br />
<span class="ml2em">One part by weight in 50 parts of glycerine.</span><br />
<span class="ml2em">One part by weight in 3 parts of absolute alcohol.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span></p>
<p>In rum, brandy, wine, cider, etc., it dissolves according to their respective
strengths and temperatures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;By contact with iron in any form salicylic acid takes a violet
color.</p>

<p>This must be noted, especially when treating milk, etc., if contained
in metallic vessels. The only bad effects will be simply slight discoloration.</p>

<h5>MEAT.</h5>

<p>It is a well-known fact that, especially in hot weather, meat, poultry,
and game, although apparently quite fresh, prove, on closer examination,
or often only when cooked, to be tainted and of bad odor. This
can be entirely removed by either watering and washing the meat in a
lukewarm solution of salicylic acid (three to four teaspoonfuls of acid
to two quarts of water), or by adding a small pinch of the dry acid in
powder, during the cooking.</p>

<p>To keep meat for several days from becoming high or tainted:</p>

<p>Place it for twenty or thirty minutes in an aqueous solution of 8
drachms of salicylic acid to one gallon of water.</p>

<p>Rub into the surface of the meat some dry salicylic acid, particularly
about the bony and fatty parts; the meat to be afterward cleaned
before cooking as usual.</p>

<p>Although the raw meat treated with the acid turns slightly pale on
the surface it suffers no change whatever internally. Meat thus
treated with salicylic acid requires, also, less cooking to render it
tender.</p>

<h5>PURE MILK.</h5>

<p>A third of a teaspoonful (or, if the temperature be high, a little
more) of the solid acid to a quart of milk delays the process of curdling
for thirty-six hours, without influencing its property of yielding cream.</p>

<h5>BUTTER.</h5>

<p>Washed with an aqueous solution (four drachms of acid to a gallon of
water), or kept in it, or wrapped in cloths soaked in this water, keeps
fresh for a very long time. Butter already rancid can be improved by
treatment with a stronger solution (8 drachms of acid to 1 gallon of
water), followed by washing in pure water. The bad smell often arising
in salted butter is entirely prevented by addition of the acid.</p>

<h5>JAMS OF ALL KINDS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, AND PICKLES.</h5>

<p>Of every description, made in the usual way, but with the addition of
about 1 drachm of salicylic acid to every 4 pounds of the preserve, will
keep sound with absolute certainty for a much longer time, fermentation
and mouldiness being prevented. Under exceptionally unfavorable
circumstances, such as hot pantries, a little of the dry acid should be
sprinkled on the top of the vessel or preserve pot. A tightly-fitting
piece of blotting paper, previously saturated with a concentrated solution
of salicylic acid in spirit, brandy, or rum, and placed on the top of
the preserves will also greatly aid in keeping them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span></p>

<h5>NEW-LAID EGGS</h5>

<p>Can be kept for a very long time by being placed for half an hour in a
cold, saturated, aqueous solution of the acid, then allowed to dry in the
air, and, as usual, kept in a cool place. Some prefer to coat them by
dipping them in melted paraffine after they have been treated in this
manner. (Use no straw or hay in packing eggs.)</p>

<h5>THE YOLK AND THE WHITE OF EGGS</h5>

<p>Are most effectually preserved for a long time by the addition of <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> to 1
ounce of the acid per 20 pounds of these substances. It is also well to
place a paper soaked in the salicylic acid solution on the top of them,
which greatly enhances the preserving effect.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of vinegar, salicylic acid is also of great importance
to prevent false or excessive fermentation, putridity, etc.</p>

<h5>WINE.</h5>

<p>With respect to wine the experiments of Prof. Neubauer of Wiesbaden
have proved that the introduction of the acid for the preservation
of wine marks an era of great industrial progress, as it energetically
prevents, even when used in very small quantities, the formation of
mould germs and other circumstances which are injurious to wine,
while it absolutely arrests secondary fermentation, cloudiness, etc. As
wine differs very much in its constitution the requisite quantity of salicylic
acid must be found out by practice in each particular case. About
<span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> to <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">3</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> of an ounce per 50 gallons will be found sufficient for most
wines. In using the salicylic acid for this purpose it is recommended
to make a strong solution of it in pure spirit, perfectly free from fusel
oil, and then to add of this solution as much as may be requisite.</p>

<p>If in addition to this the casks are washed out with an aqueous solution
of the acid it will prove of great service, and all other agents at
present used for this purpose will soon be abandoned. The larger the
amount of sugar in proportion to the alcohol the more salicylic acid
will be required. The addition is best made when the wine has attained
its full ripeness. The effervescence of wine in spring, or after carriage
in warm weather, will at once be stopped. The salicylic acid kills all
kinds of germs, and destroys the growth and action of any yeast which
may still be present; it is therefore of incalculable value in effectually
preserving wine, and as a preventive of the deterioration to which this
liquid is subject.</p>

<p>Must, fresh from the press in autumn, can be kept without fermentation
perfectly fresh, bright, and sweet for six to eight months by the
addition of 1 to <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> ounces per 50 gallon, or of <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">3</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> ounce per 100 bottles.
Sparkling Must requires an addition of 6 to 7 ounces of salicylic acid
per 100 gallons. In the same manner all kinds of fruit-wine which, as
is well known, soon turn sour, can be preserved by the addition of a
similar quantity of salicylic acid. Must kept still for transport can at
any time be set into fermentation by a slight addition of carbonate of
soda and fresh yeast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span></p>

<h5>BEER.</h5>

<p>Experiments made upon a large scale have placed beyond a doubt
the remarkable properties of salicylic acid as a preventive of secondary
fermentation and acidity in beer, and as a preservative of beer in a
sound condition when sent out or exposed to the noxious influences of
warm cellars, change of temperature, etc. The amount of salicylic acid
required to produce the best effects in preserving beer varies according
to the quality of the malt liquor; but half an ounce per barrel of 36 imperial
gallons will be very generally found to answer the purpose well.
The addition of the salicylic acid delays secondary fermentation in
stock and export beers, which may then be kept for any length of time
without becoming unsound or of unpleasant flavor. Less than a quarter
ounce of the powder of salicylic acid per barrel of boiling wort strewn
into the same while turning out will destroy or suspend the vitality of
the false ferments, especially that of the lactic ferment, in the fermenting
vats, and this not only without injury to the yeast cells, but keeping
them free from parasitical growths. In this manner the fermentation
will take a steadier course and enable the liquor to attain its perfection
during the ensuing still fermentation in the cask, into which another
quarter ounce or more of the acid is to be given per barrel a fortnight
before racking. Stout, and in fact all beers for export to a hot climate,
require rather more.</p>

<p>For long transports the acid in powder can be simply thrown into
the export casks, in which it dissolves in the course of three days instead
of a week, which is required by the cold beer lying quietly.</p>

<h5>BOTTLED BEER NOT SALICYLATED IN THE CASK.</h5>

<p>The clean bottles must be rinsed with a solution of 1 part of salicylic
acid in 4 or 5 parts of spirit (free from fusel oil), which can be poured
from 1 bottle to another. Or, a small pinch of the acid in powder is
placed in every bottle before filling.</p>

<p>The corks should always be boiled in water containing 1 ounce to the
gallon, which is also efficient in disinfecting tubes, taps, etc.</p>

<h5>CIDER.</h5>

<p>Dissolve <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">3</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> of an ounce of salicylic acid in a gallon of cider, and then
add this amount to each barrel of cider. This is superior to any preparation
of lime. The cider must be treated when fresh.</p>

<h5>GLUE, GELATINE, GUM ARABIC SOLUTIONS, PASTE, SIZE, STARCH, INK,
SKINS OF ALL KINDS, ETC.</h5>

<p>Are successfully preserved for a length of time from decomposition or
deterioration by means of salicylic acid. One-thousandth part of the
acid introduced into a vat of gelatine or into decoctions of animal matter,
prevents their undergoing decomposition for an indefinite period
of time. Calico printers are using half a pound of the acid to every 100
pounds of dressing starch, in order to entirely preclude the disagreeable
odor arising after awhile from dry goods in store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span></p>

<h5>IN THE PROCESS OF TANNING,</h5>

<p>If the bark-color be slightly salicylated, this liquor will not undergo
the change which, instead of making the hides and skins swell, often
causes the opposite effect, contracting them by an alkaline action, and
at the same time imparting to them a putrid odor. Treatment with
carbolic acid also leaves a most objectionable odor, especially in fine
leather goods. The use of salicylic acid will thus be found highly remunerative
to all tanners, as it has proved in the industries already
alluded to.</p>

<h5>IN SUGAR FACTORIES</h5>

<p>Three drachms of salicylic acid are used to every 300 pounds of beetroot
in the diffusing liquor, in order to prevent fermentation, and for
destroying the parasitical growths, especially noticeable in the old
material.</p>

<h5>FOR DISINFECTING.</h5>

<p>Fumigation with the acid purifies the air and walls of closed rooms.
Simply evaporate some on a heated shovel, which must not be red-hot.</p>

<p>The air in crowded buildings, schools, barracks, hospitals, factories,
etc., will be improved by keeping the floors sprinkled with the solution.
In sick rooms this is of great importance, the dust settling on the floor
being the readiest receptacle and means of transmitting the microscopic
fungi or germs of infection which float in the air.</p>

<h5>VESSELS, CORKS, ETC.,</h5>

<p>Are very well cleaned and disinfected by washing them with an aqueous
solution of the acid. This deserves especial notice.</p>

<p>It is evident that numerous advantageous applications of salicylic
acid are carried out besides those enumerated above, but the descriptions
already given will enable any person interested in the matter to
find out the best means of deriving profit from the wonderful properties
of this extremely useful substance.</p>


<h3>Ice-House and Refrigerator.</h3>

<p class="subhd">BY JOHN TAYLOR.</p>

<p>Houses built on this plan are lined throughout the inside with sheet
iron. There is a layer of felt nailed to the sides, ceiling, and floor of
the room, and on this is nailed the sheet iron. It is then painted with
two heavy coats, it being the aim to fill up all joints and seams with the
paint. But as the tin and felt do not render the room absolutely air-tight,
I am of opinion that it can as well be dispensed with. It might
save some ice if the seams were all soldered. The layer of cement,
asphaltum or gas tar, which should cover the ground below the joists,
is to protect the room from the moisture and warmth of the earth.
Above this layer should be about 30 inches of dry sawdust or turners
shavings, well packed up to the level of the top of the joists.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/i_073.jpg" width="330" height="407" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span></p>
<p>The drainage from the ice is carried off by a series of V-shaped tin or
iron troughs, which run between the joists, all of which carry the water
to one point, where it is carried outside by a trap-pipe. These troughs
reach over to the center of the top of the joists, and are soldered together,
so that no water will drip on the floor below. It will be seen
that in this plan there is no sawdust or other preservative in contact
with the ice, and that the air of the room circulates around and over the
ice. As long as the temperature of the goods stored is above the temperature
of the room there will be a gentle draught around the mass of
ice, and of course all the moisture in the air, vapors, and odors from
the goods will condense on the ice and pass off, so that you can keep
milk, cream, butter, fruits, and meats all in the same chamber without
danger of injuring the flavor of either. The atmosphere of the room is
always dry, sweet, and pure.</p>

<p>The features of this plan can as well be carried out by arranging a
room inside of another building.</p>

<p>I should have explained before that the ice does not rest directly on
the joists; but there is a bed of oak lath, about <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> by 3 inches, laid across
the joists, about 4 or 5 inches apart, on which the ice is laid. I would<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
further suggest that another cold chamber can as well be had by making
a cellar under the one shown, with a lattice floor between them. It
would be necessary to finish the sides and bottom of this cellar in the
most complete manner, as above described. At the entrance to the
store-room there must be a vestibule, either inside or outside, as space
or circumstances may direct. If outside the walls should be thick and
the door very heavy. The doors, both inside and outside, should be
fitted with rubber, so as to close perfectly tight, and both doors must
never be opened at the same time. This vestibule should be large
enough to contain a fair wagon load of goods, so that if you are receiving
a load of stuff you are not required to stop until all is in the vestibule
and ready to store. This house only needs filling once a year. The
temperature will range from 34 deg. in winter to 36 deg. in summer, and
will preserve fruit perfectly from season to season. The opening for
putting in the ice, shown just under the pulley in the cut, has two doors
with a space between; each door a foot thick. The window in the cold
room has three sets of sash, well packed or cemented. The walls are 13
inches thick, lined with 17 inches of sawdust. Thirty-six inches of sawdust
are put on the floor over the ice. The building shown is 25 feet
square, inside measure, and 22 feet from floor of cold room to ceiling
over the ice. The ice-room is 12 feet high, and the cold room 9 feet.
Pillars are required under the center of the ice.&mdash;<i>Country Gentleman.</i></p>


<h3>Cheap Ice-Houses.</h3>

<p>Settlers in the newer portions of the country are often deprived of
many comforts which are easily accessible in long-settled places. Whatever
contributes to lessen these privations, if at little cost, should merit
special attention. A cheap ice-house may be made to afford an important
share of country comforts in such settlements. There is nothing
to prevent an abundant supply through the heat of summer where there
is a stream or sheet of water within two or three miles from which clear
blocks of ice may be sawed. Sawdust is the best material for packing,<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>
but in its absence chaff, chopped straw, or even straw unchopped may
be made to answer the purpose.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_074.jpg" width="300" height="177" alt="" />
<p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.</p>
</div>

<p>A costly and elaborate building is no better than the cheapest
structure for keeping ice, if care is only taken to have it properly
packed, which is very easily done after one “knows how.” We have
never seen ice better preserved through a long and hot summer than in
a board shanty with only one thickness of siding, and that full of cracks
and crevices. For a new settle&shy;ment one built of logs, like that shown
in the ac&shy;com&shy;pany&shy;ing figure (Fig.&nbsp;1), may be made to answer a good
purpose. The floor may be slabs, and the roof a covering of brush to
hold the packing to its place, if a slab roof is not readily made. If sawdust
is used for packing, the crevices between the logs will need close
stopping; or, still better, it can be faced on the inside with slabs set
upright, with the smooth side inward. If straw is employed, the rough
logs may remain, and the crevices between them may be left open. For
sawdust a well-packed space of 10 inches between walls and ice will
keep the ice well; chopped straw should be 15 or 20 inches thick, and
long straw should occupy a space of 2 feet. Stiff, coarse straw will not
answer unless packed very solid; finer and softer, as of thickly sown
oats, is better, and the walls which it forms need not be quite so thick.
Fine hay would be still better, and would answer if only a foot and a
half thick and well put in. Dry swamp moss, such as nurserymen use
for packing trees and plants, would be one of the very best substances
for protecting the ice, if only a foot thick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/i_075a.jpg" width="360" height="82" alt="" />
<p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Having prepared the house and packing cut the blocks of ice of precisely
equal size, using a cross-cut saw with one handle removed, to go
under water. The size should be measured and scratched on the surface
for the saw to follow. Two feet square is a convenient size. When cut<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
lift them out with a light plank having a batten nailed across one end
to hold them (Fig.&nbsp;2). Place about 10 inches of sawdust on the floor (or
twice as much solid straw), and build the structures solid with the ice
blocks, ramming in the sawdust or other packing as the structure goes
up (Fig.&nbsp;3). When finished cover it with a thickness of packing nearly
equal to that at the sides. It is important that there be free ventilation
over the top, which the loose brush will not prevent. If there is a slab
roof the air must blow freely between this roof and the top covering.
The slab floor will allow a free drainage of all the water which runs
down through the packing from the melting ice.</p>

<p>A structure nearly as cheap as the preceding is represented in Fig.&nbsp;4.
It is made by setting rough posts into the ground with the inner sides
straight or faced with the ax, and then nailing common rough boards on
them (like a tight fence) to a sufficient height. The floor is made as
already described, and the roof may be boards or slabs. The openings
at the gables perform an important part in the ventilation by admitting
all the air that can sweep over the top sawdust. Fig.&nbsp;3, already referred
to, is the ground plan, and Fig.&nbsp;5 is a vertical section.</p>

<p>There are three requisites to be secured in order to keep the ice suc<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>cessfully:
1st. The closely packed, non-&#8203;con&shy;duct&shy;ing substance on each
side, under and above the mass of ice. 2d. Perfect drainage at the bottom
without the admission of air. 3d. Free circulation of air over the
top covering. If these requisites are observed the result will be entirely
satisfactory.&mdash;<i>Country Gentlemen.</i></p>


<h3>A Cheap Ice-Chest.</h3>

<p>Procure two dry-goods boxes, one of which is enough smaller than
the other to leave a space of 3 or 4 inches all around when it is placed
inside. Fill the space between the two with sawdust packed closely and
cover with a heavy lid made to fit neatly inside the larger box. Insert a
small pipe in the bottom of the chest to carry off the water from the
melting ice. For family or grocers’ use this will prove even more serviceable
than some of the high-priced patent refrigerators.</p>


<h3>Ice Without an Ice-House.</h3>

<p>Select a dry, shady spot; dig a ditch for carrying off the waste water,
and over it place a lath-work. Upon this lay a thick layer of moss,
leaves, or sawdust. Now pile upon this the cakes of ice, the larger the
better, and cut or sawed square in such a manner as to leave as few
spaces as possible, filling up those which may occur with fine sawdust
in order to prevent the air from penetrating into the interior of the pile.
It is best to build the pile in the form of a pyramid. When completed
it is covered with straw, moss, or leaves as thick and as close as possible,
a layer of earth being thrown upon it to secure the covering and as
a further protection to the ice. Where a stream or lake is inaccessible
from which to procure ice for filling ice-houses, especially where a
small quantity is stored, the ice can be frozen with water from the well
in boxes or other contrivance made especially for the purpose, which
we leave to the ingenuity of those who are interested.</p>


<h3>Freezing Mixtures.</h3>

<p>Refrigerating salts and mixtures are used to produce cold artificially.
They are used with or without ice or snow. As is well known common
salt mixed with pounded ice or snow lowers the temperature to a considerable
degree, so there are other mixtures which will produce a still
greater degree of cold. The following simple and cheap preparation,
when mixed according to directions, will produce artificial cold suffi<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>cient
to cool wines, etc., without the aid of ice: Take common sal-ammoniac,
well pulverized, 1 part; saltpeter, 2 parts, and mix well
together: then take common soda, well pulverized. To use, take equal
quantities of these preparations (which must be kept separate and well
covered previous to using) and put them in the freezing pot; add of
water a sufficient quantity, and put in the article to be frozen in a proper
vessel and cover up until cooled as desired.</p>

<p>These tables consist of mixtures having the power of generating or
creating cold, with or without the aid of ice, sufficient for all useful
and philosophical purposes, in any part of the world at any season:</p>

<h3>Constant Water Baths.</h3>

<p class="subhd">[<i>American Chemical Journal.</i>]</p>

<p>The following simple form of constant water bath, which wastes no
water, I have found to be very convenient:</p>

<p>A tube of glass or metal, not less than <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">4</span></span></span> of an inch internal diameter,
the ends of which are cut off obliquely, is bent as shown in the cut. It
should make an angle of about 30 deg., or a little greater, with the horizontal.
The angle may be diminished if the bore of the tube is increased.
One end is inserted in the water bath, the other in an inverted
bottle. The height of the water in the bath is regulated by the depth of
immersion of the tube in it. The boiling is not interrupted by the
feeding, which takes place slowly and regularly. It is necessary that
the ends of the tubes should be cut off obliquely. The same form of
tube answers equally well for keeping a constant level in a filter or drying
chamber.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 330px;">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="330" height="305" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A brass tube is much better than a glass one, as it does not crack at
the water level after using for a time. Brass tubes can easily be bent
by ramming full of sand, stopping the ends, and bending them over a
curved surface. A large number of baths can be run by this apparatus
by connecting them with a bath fed by it.&mdash;<i>Charles T. Pomeroy.</i></p>

<p>Note.&mdash;We have used for a number of years in this laboratory a form
of constant water bath which was contrived by Mr. Edward Bogardus,
formerly chemist to the New Jersey State Geo&shy;logical Survey. As I have
not seen it described in print, and as it is cheap, simple, efficient, and
ingenious, I will draw attention to it here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span></p>

<p>The following cut represents the apparatus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/i_081.jpg" width="220" height="249" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It consists of two tomato cans connected by a tin tube. Into one of
the cans a bottle of water is inverted. We generally use a five-pound
acid bottle. The other can makes the bath. This bath can be left running
over night without fear. A large number of baths can be run by
this contrivance by simply connecting them, by means of rubber tubes,
with a reservoir replenished by an inverted bottle. Old fruit cans make
excellent baths. A series of holes can be punched round the lower edge
of a fruit can, thus affording a distributing reservoir. Corks holding
short pieces of glass tube are inserted into the holes. By means of
these the reservoir can be connected by rubber tubes with a number of
baths at quite a distance. The baths are made by punching a hole near
the lower edge of a fruit can and inserting a cork and short piece of
glass tube. When the extra vents of the reservoir are not used, they can
be closed by a short rubber coupling and a pinch cock.&mdash;<i>Peter T.

Scientific School).</i></p>


<h3>Silos and Ensilage.</h3>

<p>The practice of preserving roots, vegetables, and plants by covering
them with earth or by placing them in cellars, etc., is an ancient one,
but the practical application of the principle on a large scale to the
preservation of fodder-corn, clover, etc., as a food for stock is comparatively
a recent practice, the first silo in this country having been built
within the last twelve years. Previously, however, the French and English
gave the subject considerable attention, but it seems that within the
last two or three years our American experimenters have made great
improvements in the process and construction of the silo by which more<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
successful results have been attained than ever before and have awakened
much interest among the progressive class of farmers and stock-growers
throughout the country.</p>

<p>A number of the Agricultural Experiment Stations located in the
different States, particularly those of Wisconsin, Illinois, and also the
Agricultural College at Guelph, Ontario, have made extensive applications
of the process. Several articles from them detailing the success
of the experiments for the past season have appeared in the columns of
<i>The Breeder’s Gazette</i> of this city. Through the courtesy of the editor
and Prof. W.&nbsp;A. Henry of the Wisconsin Agri&shy;cultural Experiment Station
we are enabled to present full instructions in regard to con&shy;structing
and filling a silo. These, with clippings which we include from the
writings of others high in authority on the subject, contain as full an
account of recent experiments as we can give with our limited space.</p>

<p>“Agriculture never took a longer stride in advance than it did when
the silo was added to the practical equipment of the farm. Most of us
were slow to realize this at first, and a great many are yet unwilling to
concede the advantages claimed for the silo, but the utility of the modern
silo cannot be gainsaid, for without it we are left at the mercy of the
elements in the handling of our great corn crop. There was much truth
in the statement that the silo as first introduced was too expensive for
the average farmer, but in no department of the farm has there been
such a change of opinion and methods of attaining desired results as is
the case with the silo. The modern wooden building is not only less
expensive but vastly superior to the original cellar or stone structure
and every year’s experience is throwing light in hitherto dark places, so
that in a short time the progressive dairyman or beef-raiser will think
no more of filling his silo than our fathers did of filling the barn with
hay, and with proper facilities for handling the corn no part of the silo
work will be as hard as pitching hay over the ‘big beam.’” *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
<i>Supt. Adams, Wis. Agr. Exp. Station.</i></p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* A <i>silo</i> is a place where fodder is preserved in a succulent
condition. It may be a pit, a box, a mow, a tank, a building, or a trench
in the earth. <i>Silage</i> is the word denoting the fodder so preserved. <i>Ensilage</i>
is the term applied to the process or system. <i>Ensile</i> is the verb
expressive of the action of making silage. <i>Ensilor</i> stands for the person
using the <i>silo</i> to <i>ensile</i> fodder for <i>silage</i> by the process of <i>ensilage</i>.
&mdash;<i>Prof. James W. Robertson, Ontario Agr. Col., Guelph.</i></p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I further believe that our present knowledge of the silo and
the best methods of storing crops therein is not perfect, and that we
will make great advancement in the future; but that we have reached a
point where this method is within the possibilities of our average farmers,
and it is this class most of all that needs this method. The time
has come when we must produce more beef, butter, wool, and pork to
the acre or sink beneath the wave of competition that is driving over our
land. The silo seems to be a valuable and important means to this
end.&mdash;<i>Prof. W.&nbsp;A. Henry.</i></p>

<h4>CONSTRUCTING THE SILO.&mdash;BY PROF. W.&nbsp;A. HENRY.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<a id="DOUBLE_SILO"></a>
<img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="430" height="326" alt="" />
<p class="tac">A 100-TON DOUBLE SILO.</p>
</div>

<p>“Silos are like houses, no two individuals can agree upon the same
plan; for this reason I approach this branch of the subject with no expectation
of pleasing all or of giving directions for making a perfect
structure. I deem it best to give a description of one way in which a
double silo may be built and leave it to the reader to introduce such
modifications in the plan as may best meet his particular wants and
circumstances. The drawing herewith presented shows an ideal two-room
silo 16 feet wide, 32 feet long, and 16 feet to the eaves. Built as
described each room would have a capacity of over 3,000 cubic feet which
would contain about 50 tons of settled ensilage weighing 35 pounds to
the cubic foot. We may say then that this figure represents a 100-ton
silo. For the foundation of this structure either brick or stone may be
used, going deep enough to avoid heaving by the frost and rising 6
inches or 1 foot above the surface of the level ground about it. Upon
this wall a sill should be laid which had best be constructed of 2×10
inch plank. One of the difficulties in silo construction is to avoid
spreading of the building, which sometimes occurs through lateral
pressure of the contents when settling. For this reason the sills must
be well tied together at the corners; instead of using square timbers,
which are greatly weakened by cutting, plank may be substituted and
the corners of the sill constructed as in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#FIG_2">2</a>. If well spiked there
will be no danger from spreading at the corners. The plank of which
the sills are constructed should be at least 8 inches wide; 10 would be<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
better. By using four of these, lying one on top of another, the sill will
be 8 inches thick. Midway between the ends of the building a cross
wall should be built, and on this a sill should be laid upon which to
erect the partition which divides the silo into two compartments. This
cross wall should be so worked into the side walls as to hold them
securely, and thus prevent the silo from spreading on the sides. A little
ingenuity will make the foundation and sills secure. If possible the
sills should be as wide as the wall upon which it rests, but if this cannot
be conveniently done the wall of stone or brick should be raised above
the ground but a very few inches at most, as the ensilage in settling on
the shoulder made by the jutting wall is almost certain to spoil at that
point. Having laid the sill upon the wall in the manner described
proceed to erect the building by standing 2×8 or 10-inch studding perpendicularly
upon this sill, placing them not further apart than every 16
inches, so that a sheet of tarred building paper will lap two studding in
each case. The reader is cautioned to measure the building paper care<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>fully,
before setting up the studding, as it is sometimes scant in width
and trouble will occur when one attempts to tack on the paper. Double
the studding at the corners. In the illustration of the building I have
not placed the proper number of studding, but the reader can rest
assured that once in 16 inches is not too often. Having placed our
studding in position and secured them by a plate running around the
top we are ready for the rafters. Fig.&nbsp;3 shows how these rest upon the
plates and how they are tied together so as to least interfere with the
filling of the silo. For a cheap silo boards may be used, though probably
shingles are the cheapest in the end. In the roof upon one side
place a dormer window at <a href="#DOUBLE_SILO">D</a> in the illustration; this window is immediately
over the partition. It is intended that the ensilage carrier shall
pass up through the window so that the ensilage will fall over the partition
and can be deposited in either one of the two compartments by
means of a slanting chute. If one does not wish to undergo the expense
of the dormer window a scuttle in the roof is all that is necessary. The
roof is the same as for any building.</p>

<p>“We are now ready to sheathe the silo; let us begin on the inside.
First of all tack tarred building paper to the studding, running the
strips up and down and having them catch on every third studding.
Avoid all openings or rents in the paper. Having placed the paper take
common boards dressed on one side and sheet up to the top of the studding.
When this is completed repeat the operation by placing a second
layer of boards over the first, breaking joints. Narrow boards are
preferable to wide ones for this work, as they will swell without bulging.
We have double-boarded the inside of our silo by this operation,
and rendered it practically impervious to the air. I see no reason for
using anything but common lumber for this purpose, as upon swelling
it will close up tight enough to keep out the air. Upon the outside of
the studding tack building paper again, as shown at Fig. <a href="#DOUBLE_SILO">C</a> in the first
illustration. Over this paper place any kind of boards that the fancy
of the builder may dictate, as clapboards, shiplap, or drop-siding. It
will be seen that our walls are constructed as follows, beginning at the
outside: First, siding; second, building paper; third, a dead-air space
of 8 or 10 inches; fourth, building paper; fifth, common boards; sixth,
common boards. No sawdust, tanbark, or other filling should be used,
as a dead-air space is a better non-conductor for our purpose and less
expensive than any of these. The partition can be built of narrower
studding than those used on the sides of the building, and one thickness
of boards used on each side, together with building paper, as in the first
instance, is sufficient. To prevent lateral pressure bulging the silo two
iron rods should be run through the partition walls joining the sides of
the building, placing one about two feet above the partition sill and the
other about four feet above that. Half or three-fourths-inch rods with
heavy caps at the ends should be sufficient, and are easily put in place
before the boards are tacked to the partition.</p>

<p>“Two doorways should be left by cutting out a single studding in each
compartment upon the most convenient side. These doorways reach to<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
within three feet of the ground, and should be about seven feet in
height. They need not reach to within five feet of the top of the building.
The ensilage will settle in the silo several feet, and when the time
comes to pass it out through the doorway it takes but little time to dig
down two or three feet to the top of the door and make an opening large
enough to pass out the upper layer. Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#FIG_1">1</a> shows one of the ways in
which a doorway may be made so that it can be boarded up air-tight.
Instead of making solid doors hung on hinges I think it is better to use
boards that will fit in crossways, making them double thick, and having
the inside board even with the inside boarding of the silo, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#FIG_1">1</a>. Do not make the doorways over 6 or 7 feet in length vertically,
as in all cases they weaken the structure. Endeavor to have the inside
of the silo smooth and perpendicular from top to bottom, with no
jogs or shoulders upon which the ensilage can catch or drag.</p>

<p>“If built above ground fill the rooms of the two compartments with
earth until the surface is three or four inches above the outside level, so
that no water will at any time enter to injure the ensilage that rests on
the ground. I do not yet know which is the best method of preserving
the silo from decaying. This is an important branch of the topic, but
it has thus far received little attention. Some have recommended using
kerosene for an inside coating. We shall try that this season, and also
gas or roofing tar, which I think will be excellent. This roofing tar
when heated becomes liquid, and can be applied with a mop to the inside
of the silo. As soon as it cools it hardens into an impervious
glossy layer that I should think eminently adapted to this purpose.</p>

<p>“Having no ceiling or floor, and being built of common material,
there is no necessity for the silo being an expensive structure. Of course
the reader will modify the description given to suit his own wants and
circumstances, but I can assure him that in some such way he can provide
a silo at no great expense.</p>

<p>“After the structures built for the special purpose comes the modification
of building already erected. A great many farmers are building
over bays in their barns for silos. This is easily accomplished by placing
studding all around the bay and double boarding on the inside. If one
fears cold weather he can make a dead-air space by using two sets of
studding and boarding on the inside of the bay. Stone buildings can
be converted into good silos by furring out and double boarding on the
inside. In general I am adverse to stone structures for this purpose
unless thus boarded. Some kinds of stone seem to do very well, but
stone walls carry off the heat and moisture too rapidly to make good
silo walls. If one wishes to try preserving corn-fodder and cannot
afford a structure of wood, he can excavate a pit in the earth and bury
the corn-fodder therein, though I am sure he will soon give up this
practice as unduly expensive.</p>

<p>“A word in regard to the location of the silo. It may be built adjoining
the feeding barn with the doors so placed that the ensilage be
conveyed directly to the cattle, or if that is not possible, place it where
the ensilage can be conveyed by a car or cart. Mr. Hiram Smith of this<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
State, who has large silos and uses ensilage extensively, holds that it is
not inconvenient to have the silo located a few rods from the feeding
barn. The ensilage is pitched into a cart with forks and the cart driven
into the feeding barn between the two rows of cows which stand facing
each other. The ensilage is placed in front of the animals directly from
the cart with great rapidity. In some cases a car can be used which can
be run down grade into the barn in front of the cattle. I think either of
these methods is preferable to attempting to carry ensilage in baskets
any distance.</p>

<h4>FILLING THE SILO.</h4>

<p>“Probably very few stone silos will be built in the future, for experience
shows that a stone wall chills the ensilage during the curing
process and if it does not seriously injure that portion next to it to a
thickness of several inches it renders it at least less palatable than ensilage
nearer the middle of the silo. One reason, in my judgment, that
the silo has not won more friends in the Eastern States is owing to the
common use of stone in its construction. On our experimental farm at
Madison our first silo, built in 1881, was of stone, and our conclusions
in regard to ensilage were made up from results obtained with this silo;
had we put up a wooden structure I am confident our results would
have been worth vastly more to our people than they have been.</p>

<p>“The question of stacking ensilage is sometimes raised, being urged
upon our people by the practice of our English friends, who are experimenting
quite largely in this direction. It will be no more profitable
to stack ensilage in the Northern States than to stack hay, and even
less so in my judgment, for the waste would be very considerable and no
one would relish the job of handling it during bad weather. Silos built
of wood or made by changing over the bays of barns are the proper
structures, judging from our present knowledge, for the Northern
States; our friends at the South may find stacking successful.</p>

<p>“Having constructed the silo somewhat after the one described,
though, be it remembered, large latitude is allowed in this matter, we
will proceed to fill it with one of the two crops most suitable for the
purposes; clover or fodder-corn. If clover is to be used I would recommend
that a hay-loader be tried for the purpose of picking it up just as
left by the mower. I have hopes that some form of hay-loader will do
this work satisfactorily. The clover, either fresh or partly wilted, in
any degree of dryness indeed, may be carried at once and unloaded into
the silo, care being taken to fill and tramp down the corners and along
the edges so that when all has thoroughly settled there will be no air
spaces to favor decay. To fill a silo with clover is indeed a most simple
process. By having two divisions the pits can be filled alternately, each
layer of material heating up to the required temperature before the next
is placed over it.</p>

<p>“For fodder-corn the processes are a little more complex, though in
reality very simple. The fodder-corn should be allowed to approach
maturity, the best point for cutting being not far from that at which we<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
would ordinarily cut any shock. By this I do not mean to allow the
leaves to become dry and crisp, but rather that they show a change from
deep rank green to that yellowish tinge indicative of maturity, though
with still an abundance of moisture in them. Formerly ensilage corn
was cut shortly after the tassel appeared. Without doubt very considerable
loss was incurred by such a practice.</p>

<p>“It is evident that if we cut our fodder at the time the corn is glazing
our practice is as near correct as the present stage of investigation
points out. Since the period of filling the silo will occupy several days,
or even a couple of weeks, we must gauge the date of commencement to
strike the best average conditions. For cutting the fodder some parties
recommend the use of the reaper, but I judge from what I have been
told that a good many rakes have been broken in attempting the work,
and that many have given them up and gone back to the use of the corn
knife. Such must be the case usually, at least where large varieties of
corn are grown. The stalks should be cut close to the ground and
thrown into bundles or gavels. If the weather is at all threatening I
think it proper to cut and shock, since the fodder will dry off much
more rapidly if rain falls, and it will not be so muddy and disagreeable
to handle as when laid on the ground.</p>

<p>“Last season the writer urged that the fodder be wilted before it was
put into the silo, and his own experience, with that of many others,
corroborates this method of procedure, which has the additional advantage
that less water is handled in the operation. If it is intended to
allow the fodder to wilt the corn had better be cut and shocked, after
which it may stand from three to ten days, depending upon the maturity
of the stalks at time of cutting and the weather. If the fodder dries out
rapidly, from four days to a week is amply long for it to stand in shock,
while if the weather is somewhat damp or the fodder quite green it may
even stand ten days with no loss. One of the advantages of cutting and
shocking is that when it is over the force of men employed in this
operation can be changed to filling the silo. If the corn is cut and
placed in the silo at once quite a force of hands is needed, but by cutting
and shocking first we can avoid this double force.</p>

<p>“For drawing to the silo truck wagons are better than ordinary ones,
since the fodder is more easily loaded upon them. The common practice
is to attach a plank to the rear of the wagon, up which the men can
walk with their arms full of fodder, which should be placed with tops
all one way for ease in unloading. If the fodder is to be put through
the feed-cutter the cutter should be placed so that the carrier will deposit
it in either of the two pits as required. Formerly the carriers were so
constructed that they would not work ad&shy;van&shy;tageously at a much greater
angle than 45 deg., but now I note that some manufacturers have them
arranged to carry almost vertically.</p>

<p>“In regard to the kind of feed-cutter to be used, it may be said that
there are several valuable machines before the public, any one of which
will prove satisfactory if properly managed. The only point I desire to
urge is that a large machine be purchased, one having about double the<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
advertised capacity. Small cutters are a nuisance; hand-power cutters
are out of the question. The cutter should be driven by three horses on
a sweep power or two on a tread, or by a steam engine. Many farmers
delay ordering the cutter until within a week or two of the time to fill
the silo and are obliged to wait weeks until it is received, thereby suffering
great inconvenience and loss. As soon as the question is settled in
favor of having a silo a cutter should be selected and ordered, and it
should be set up and run in a test trial not less than a week before
actual filling is contemplated, so that repairs or changes can be made.
To run a feed-cutter properly requires considerable experience and
some knowledge of machinery, and many persons have suffered serious
losses by not giving this side of the subject due attention.</p>

<p>“This brings me to a point in the discussion of considerable interest
to many persons who desire to have silos but dread the experience and
expense of machinery. Corn-fodder may be preserved in a perfectly
satisfactory manner without running it through the feed-cutter, and
may be drawn from the field and deposited directly in the silo. The
expense of putting corn-fodder through the feed-cutter, first and last, is
not far from half of all that incurred from the time of cutting the fodder
to closing the silo. To fill the silo with long fodder let it be drawn
in the usual manner and lifted at once into the pit, which can be accomplished
in several ways, either by hand or the horse hay-fork carrier
and slings. In the silo it should be distributed evenly and probably
had better be placed in regular layers, lapping “shingle fashion” so
that it will settle evenly.</p>

<p>“The use of long fodder for the silo has been urged with considerable
vigor by Mr. I.&nbsp;J. Clapp of Kenosha, Wis., one of <i>The Breeder’s
Gazette’s</i> correspondents, and I think much good has resulted from his
advocacy. There is no doubt but that long fodder will keep just as well
as that which is cut up, and I am not at all certain but such ensilage is
even better in some cases than that made by cutting up the stalks into
small pieces. When cut into small pieces the fodder is considerably
bruised, and there is much more exposure of the juices to the air than
there is where whole fodder is used. My attention was called to this
point by a recent letter from Mr. Clapp, and I hope we can make some
observations on the subject in the future. At any rate let those parties
who either from choice or necessity do not wish to use the feed-cutter
hesitate no longer in regard to the silo if they wish to try it, but go
ahead and place the whole fodder in one, and I am confident they will
not be disappointed in its feeding qualities. The only difficulty with
long fodder comes at the time it is to be taken out for feeding purposes;
then if large varieties have been used the man who attempts to get it
out of the silo will need strong muscles and a large degree of patience
to enable him to tug at the compact mass, which is quite difficult to
manage. Twenty-five cows will eat up the ensilage about as fast as one
man can get it out. It may be just as economical, however, to put two
men into the silo for an hour or two each day during the winter, when
labor is cheap, to get out the ensilage as it is to use more expensive<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
labor in the fall to accomplish the extra work of running the feed-cutter.</p>

<p>“Slow filling is without doubt the best method for securing good
ensilage, no matter what material we are using, be it clover, long fodder-corn,
or fodder cut fine. When the pit has been filled three or four feet
deep no more should be placed within it until this layer has heated to
the neighborhood of 125 deg. Fahrenheit. Mr. John Gould of Ohio, who
has been a deep student of this subject from the practical side, I believe
holds that the ensilage should be allowed to pile up as it falls from the
carrier, and after the pile has heated to the right temperature it should
be distributed evenly over the silo, throwing that which is hottest to the
corners and along the walls. It is certain that ensilage usually heats up
easily and rapidly except in the corners and along the walls, where we
find the temperature does not rise so rapidly nor to the same degree as
it does in the body of the silo, and anything that will help us overcome
this lack will improve its quality, and I deem Mr. Gould’s suggestion a
valuable one. No packing down is needed except in the corners and
along the walls; at these points we endeavor to firm the ensilage just as
much as possible. I wish we could avoid this operation, and in the
future we may do so. I believe the ensilage would be better without any
tramping and packing if we could only get it to settle uniformly without.
We should endeavor to secure an elevation in temperature of from
120 to 140 deg. uniformly throughout the mass of material. If the contents
of the silo heat up to different degrees in different places we cannot
expect them to be uniform in quality, though all will be eaten by
the stock. The theory advanced by Mr. Fry of England that a temperature
of 122 deg. Fahrenheit destroyed the ferment that produced the
temperature seems hardly correct, for we find that the temperature
goes on beyond this very rapidly&mdash;indeed, it is often very difficult
to hold it below 140 or 150 deg., while in other cases I have
known silos in which I could detect no faulty handling of the crop that
would not heat to 120 deg. A case in point occurred last season; while
we were busy filling our silos at the experimental farm I was called to
the telephone by a young farmer living some thirty miles away who
asked several questions about temperatures. I answered him to the
best of my ability and the matter dropped from my mind. A couple of
hours afterward, however, the party himself appeared on the scene in a
troubled state of mind; he said he feared that he could not make his
case plain through the telephone, and so had come on the first train to
consult personally. His ensilage would not heat up to 120 deg., but was
moulding badly instead. I advised that he go on filling the silo, ignoring
the temperature question entirely. He did so, and in the winter reported
satisfactory results. In my opinion we have much to learn in
regard to this ferment, and that very close, patient study will be required
to bring out the scientific side in a satisfactory manner. Fortunately
we do not have to be very particular in our practice to obtain a very
good quality of ensilage. I would advise, therefore, that a person
allow the temperature to run from 120 to 140 when the thermometer is<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
buried a foot deep in the fodder; but when these conditions are not
obtained, no matter whether the degree be lower or higher, to go right
on without feeling anxious in the matter. If the contents of the silo
do not heat at all, or if the temperature gets up to 160 deg., the cattle
will still eat the ensilage without complaint and relish it better than
average dry fodder. I speak pretty positively upon this point because
novices find it difficult to get over it and become quite excited and
nervous if they cannot attain the exact directions given by most writers
on this subject. The best rule is to go ahead, do the best one can, and
the cattle will be very well satisfied with the result. Remember that
the experience of a single individual or a single season may be no
criterion for other cases. The reasons for these great variations are not
yet apparent.</p>

<p>“Silo filling may go on for two or three weeks, or until the pits are
filled, when they should be covered after standing a day or two to allow
the last layer to heat. For covering material there may be placed over
the ensilage building paper upon which may be placed sand, earth,
chaff, cut straw, marsh hay, long straw, sawdust, or almost any material
which will help keep out the air. If one wishes the pits may be left uncovered,
in which case something like a foot of the ensilage will decay
and form a covering and protection for that beneath. The practice of
weighting the silo is now largely abandoned, though I am not certain
but what some heavy material along the edges and in the corners will
aid in saving the ensilage at those points, since it is here that the contents
do not settle so well as does the body of the material. For a few
weeks after filling the sides and corners should be tramped down occasionally
to aid them in settling.”</p>

<h4>PLANTING, CUTTING, FEEDING, ETC.</h4>

<p>The following extracts from “Bulletin No. 2,” Illinois Agricultural
Experiment Station, by Thomas F. Hunt, answers some important
questions in regard to planting, etc.:</p>

<p>“The filling of the silo was practically continuous, and was done in
three days, Aug. 20 to 22, 1887, with 54,525 lbs.&mdash;twenty-seven and a quarter
tons&mdash;of green corn. About twenty tons of this consisted of a medium
sized, fairly early yellow dent corn (Murdock), which had been planted
May 4 to 6, in rows 3 feet 9 inches apart, with two to three kernels
dropped every 9 to 12 inches in each row. At the time of cutting the
stalks had well-formed but small ears, the kernels of which had largely
passed the milk state; that is, the kernels were mostly glazed. The
lower leaves were yellowish, and some had begun to dry. The growth,
though not large, was thought satisfactory, considering the long-continued
and severe drouth that had prevailed here. The yield was not
more than seven tons of fresh fodder per acre. Seven tons consisted of
a large, late maturing yellow dent corn (Leaming), which had been
planted May 28, 1887. The kernels were in the milk and the leaves were
entirely green. No marked difference was noted between the ensilage
from this and that from the other corn. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span></p>

<p>“Feeding the ensilage was begun March 10, 1888, by mixing it with
twice its bulk of dry, cut corn-fodder, not corn-stover, which our stock
had been chiefly fed during the winter. The cattle soon learned to like
the ensilage, and after the first week it was fed without mixing with any
other substance and was eaten rather better, on the whole, than corn-fodder
had been previously.</p>

<p>“Dairy weights of ensilage fed to the stock were not taken. From
what weighing was done it is estimated that from March 17 to April 30
700&nbsp;lbs. on an average were fed daily. During this time the following
cattle were given ensilage: March 17 to April 30 two aged and five
yearling bulls, one heifer, and one dry cow were fed ensilage, hay, and
grain; eight milch cows, ensilage, straw, and grain; ten dry cows and
five heifers, ensilage and straw. March 17 to April 16, three steers were
fed ensilage and corn. April 13 to 30, four heifers and two dry cows
were fed ensilage and hay. It will thus be seen that for 45 days 37 head
were, on an average fed 700 lbs., about 19 each, daily. Of these 15 had
ensilage and straw only; 8 had ensilage and straw with grain, usually
four quarts of bran added daily; and 9 ensilage, hay, and grain. All
thrived exceedingly well considering the amount of food eaten.”</p>

<h2>PART II.&mdash;<a id="STAGE_ILLUSIONS"></a>STAGE ILLUSIONS.</h2>


<h3>The Three-Headed Woman.</h3>

<p>In the booths of the market fairs at Paris and its suburbs (for example,
at the “Gingerbread” Fair, at the Féte of St. Cloud, etc.), and in
the tricks of jugglers, etc., who operate in the street, café concerts, or
circuses, we find phenomena that have a true scientific interest, ingenious
applications of different sciences, or simply tricks that puzzle
the spectator. Since, in general, people like to know the secret of what<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
has surprised them, it may not prove uninteresting to devote a few
articles to what may be called “side-show science.” We will first
speak of the process employed to produce the “three-headed woman.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_093.jpg" width="400" height="397" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The exterior of the little booth in which this phenomenon is exhibited
is covered by a large painted canvas representing a three-headed
woman in evening costume in a richly decorated drawing-room along
with a few persons. For better convincing the curious a photograph
taken from nature exhibits the phenomenal woman as she appears in
the show; and every now and then the showman stops his drum to cry,
“She is living, ladies and gentlemen, she is living!” If we allow ourselves
to be persuaded to enter the booth we shall find ourselves separated
from the stage by a balustrade&mdash;a sort of screen, behind which is
the curtain. In a few moments the latter separates and there is distinctly
seen a woman’s body, the lower part of which is hidden by a
basket of flowers. This body has three heads; one in the middle and
two others grafted at the base of the neck of the first. These three heads
move their eyes, answer together a few questions put by the showman,
stick out their tongues, sing a few snatches of a popular song, and
finally salute the audience, when the curtain closes and the show is
over.</p>

<p>On almost every occasion some ingenious person is heard to express
pity for this unfortunate person, who has no legs and three heads. This
is the best praise that could be bestowed on the trick&mdash;for naturally it
is only a trick. Moreover the showman is ready, for money, to explain
how it is done. If we allow ourselves to be tempted, and enter the side-scene,
we perceive on the little stage where the phenomenal woman just
appeared nothing but a large plate of glass, slightly inclined toward the
audience, and its edges hidden by drapery. Behind the mirror there is
a recess whose sides are covered with a dead-black fabric. In front of
the mirror, on the stage, sits the basket of flowers from which issued
the woman’s body. Then on an inclined board a little above the ground
lie three young girls. One of these, the middle one, is clothed in a
brilliant costume of silk of a light color, and it is she who, in the exhibition,
makes the trunk, arms, and the middle head. Her legs are
covered over with a black fabric, and she is supported by a cushion so
as to permit the two other girls to place their necks closely against hers.
The bodies of these two girls at the sides are completely covered with a
fabric of a dead-black color. In front of these three young women are
placed a dozen strong kerosene lamps provided with reflectors.</p>

<p>The heads, hair, and arms of the “body” are covered with powder, so
as to present completely white surfaces. Such is the secret as revealed
from the side-scene, and it will now be understood how the phenomenon
is produced. All the white or light-colored surfaces being strongly
lighted by the lamps that reflect the light, their image is sent by the
glass toward the spectators, who perceive then the body of the female,
her two arms, and her three heads. All the portions covered with black
are, on the contrary, absolutely invisible in the glass, and the spectators<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
cannot see that they exist. The phenomenon is, on the whole, a curious
application of the effects of reflection which were in fashion some
twenty years ago under the name of “living ghosts,” and by means of
which it was possible in theaters to cause the apparition, alongside of
living persons, either of undecided forms or of bodies not resting on
the ground.</p>

<p>The “Gingerbread” Fair this year showed a two-headed woman produced
by a slightly different process, the body and head of the woman
being seen directly, and the second head alone being seen by reflection
from a glass. This phenomenon may be varied to infinity, so to speak.
To cite only a few examples, there may be produced by the same process
a decapitated person who talks; a decapitated person who holds his
head in his hand, and a Judith and Holofernes, the head of the latter
being held by the hair by the former.&mdash;<i>La Nature.</i></p>


<h3>The Mysterious Voice.</h3>

<p>“Some time ago,” says a correspondent of <i>La Nature</i>, “I was walking
around in a side show in which were exhibited mechanical portraits,
when I was surprised to hear myself called: ‘Monsieur! Monsieur!’ *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
I discovered that the voice came from a tin trumpet, which was held in
the mouth of a negro’s head made of wood, and suspended by a small
brass chain from semicircles of iron supported by a wooden frame”
(Fig.&nbsp;1). The effect produced on the spectators by this speaking head
was one of universal astonishment, and no one was capable of solving<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
the mystery. The arrangement for producing the illusion is very simple,
however, and is thus explained by the writer above referred to:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 255px;">
<img src="images/i_095.jpg" width="255" height="261" alt="" />
<p class="tac"><span class="smcap lowercase">FIG. 1.&mdash;THE SPEAKING HEAD.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A person hidden behind the scenes speaks into a tube two or three
centimeters in diameter which runs from that point to the wooden
frame, and in the interior of the horizontal and upright pieces of which
it passes till it reaches the suspended head at A, as shown by the dotted
lines, E, D, C, B, A. The voice thus transmitted is reflected from the
sides of the trumpet, H, to the person holding a conversation with the

<p>This experiment, which is analogous to the one that precedes, was
explained by Nicholson, in 1832, in his <i>Journal de Physique</i>. Although
at first offered as a physical experiment, under the title of an “experiment
in acoustics,” it has since changed name and master, and is now
dignified by the imposing name of “invisible girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span></p>

<p>Fig.&nbsp;2 shows the arrangement of the original apparatus, which consisted
of a glass case, X, about four feet long by about one in height,
suspended from the ceiling by four chains at a distance of a foot from
the window frame. From the extremity of the case projected a speaking
trumpet, and the entire apparatus was surrounded by a latticework
of iron wire to prevent its being touched by the hands of the curious.
The phenomenon, although a puzzling novelty at the time, did not
attract much of a crowd, as it was not managed with sufficient address,
and the surroundings were not of a nature to please fashionable people.
This apparatus was improved upon and rendered more elegant in appearance
by Prof. Robertson. Fig.&nbsp;3, copied from an old engraving,
shows this latter arrangement. A globe, A, made of glass or enameled
sheet iron, and to which are attached four trumpets, is suspended from
the middle of the room. This globe is not necessary for the experiment,
but is only an accessory to impose upon the imagination. Around it is
placed a framework, B, which is very necessary, for it is hollow, and it
is through it that the voice of the invisible person is heard. A tin tube
passes through the upright C and then runs to D, where there is a small
slit or aperture opposite the trumpet. This tin tube passes under the
floor of the room, and runs into the neighboring room, whence the pretended
invisible person speaks, and sees everything through the keyhole
or through an aperture in the wall. This is all there is of the mystery.</p>


<h3>An Improved Psycho.</h3>

<p>Let me explain to those who have not seen “Psycho” that it consists
of a small figure dressed as a Turk, sitting cross-legged (as shown
by dotted lines) on a chest; this chest is in turn supported on a
glass tube, about 12&nbsp;in. in diameter and 3&nbsp;ft. long, which rests on a
four-legged stool. The bottom of chest and top of stool are covered
with green cloth, so as to make a tolerably air-tight joint. The right
arm is extended as per drawing, and a semicircular rack, in which are
placed the 13 cards dealt to “Psycho,” is fixed by means of a bracket
(not shown) in such a position that the edges come between the finger
and thumb, as shown at *. The arm turning horizontally on the pivot A,
the hand can be brought over any card, and by closing the finger and
thumb and raising the arm the card will be withdrawn from the rack and
held in the air.</p>

<p>In Figs. 1<i>a</i> and 1<i>b</i> (elevation and plan) the wheels E and M have
each a train of clockwork (left out for the sake of clearness), which
would cause them to spin round if unchecked. M, however, has two
pins, <i>p</i> <i>p′</i>, which catch on a projection on the lever, N. E is a crown-wheel
escapement&mdash;like that in a bottle roasting-jack&mdash;which turns A
alternately to the left and right, thus causing the hand to traverse the 13
cards. A little higher on A will be seen a quadrant B (see plan) near
the edge of which are set 13 little pins. The end of the lever N drops<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
between any two of them, thus causing the hand to stop at any desired
card. The lever being pivoted at <i>c</i> it is obvious that by pressing the
end, N, B will be set at liberty, and the hand will move along the cards;
by slightly raising it this motion will be arrested; by raising it still
more the pin <i>p</i> is released and M commences to revolve, and by again
depressing N this wheel will in its turn be stopped. Near the bottom
of the apparatus is a bellows O, which contains a spring tending to keep
the lever N, with which it is connected by a rod X, in the position shown.
This is connected with the tubular support, which may be connected by
a tube through the leg of the stool, and another tube beneath the stage,
with an assistant behind the scenes. By compressing or exhausting air
through this tube it is obvious that the lever, N, will be raised or depressed,
and the clockwork set going accordingly. <i>a</i> is a crankpin set
in M, and connected with the head by catgut, T, and with the thumb
by S.</p>

<p>At R and R′ are two pulleys connected by gut. Thus if the hand
moves round the head appears to follow its motions, and when raised by<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
pulling S the head rises also by means of T. Further explanation
seems almost unnecessary; <i>l</i> is a stop to prevent the elbow moving too
far, and <i>b</i> <i>b′</i> spiral springs to keep thumb open and head forward
respectively. When N is raised M pulls T and S, the latter closing
thumb, and then raising arm by pulley H. If the lever is allowed to
drop <i>p′</i> will catch and keep arm up. On again raising N the arm will
descend.</p>

<p>Figs. 2<i>a</i> and 2<i>b</i> show another and simpler arrangement, in which
only one train of clockwork is used. On the same axle as H is fixed a
lever and weight, W, to balance the arm. A vertical rod, X, having a
projection, Z, slides up and down in guides, Y Y, and carries the catgut
S and T. The quadrant, B, has cogs cut, between which Z slides and
stops the motion of A, which is moved, as before, by clockwork. The
lower part of X is connected direct with O. When X is slightly raised,
as shown, A is free to move, but on exhausting air and drawing X down
Z enters the cogs and stops the hand over a card; continuing to exhaust
the thumb closes and the card is lifted up. The details of the clockwork
I leave to the ingenuity of your readers. There should be a fan on
each train to regulate the speed. The figure should be so placed that<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>

Mechanic.</i></p>


<h3>Magic Cabinets, Boxes, Etc.</h3>

<p>Magic cabinets are much employed by magicians. The following is
an example of one of the scenes that may occur with them:</p>

<p>When the curtain rises there is seen in the center of the stage a large
dark colored cabinet, ornamented with mouldings, and mounted upon
legs that are a little longer than those of ordinary cabinets, the object
being to remove all possibility of a communication with the stage beneath.
These legs are provided with casters. The showman turns this
cabinet around and shows that there is nothing abnormal about it externally.
He then asks some of the spectators to come up close to it,
and lets them examine its interior, which is entirely empty. There is
no double bottom, nor any hiding place. When the witnesses have
made themselves certain of this fact they station themselves around the
stage, and a certain number of them even consent to remain behind the
cabinet and see nothing of the experiment. The cabinet being thus
surrounded on all sides, and even one being able to look under it, fraud
would seem to be an impossibility.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="430" height="298" alt="" />
<p class="tac"><span class="smcap lowercase">FIG.</span> 1.</p>
</div>

<p>A young woman dressed as a danseuse then comes onto the stage and
enters the cabinet (Fig.&nbsp;1), and the doors are closed upon her. In a few
moments the doors are opened again, when, lo and behold! the closet is<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
empty, the young woman having disappeared. Then the doors are closed
again, and then opened, and the danseuse makes her appearance; and
so on. At the end of the experiment the witnesses examine the cabinet
again, and, finding nothing changed therein, are justly stupefied.</p>

<p>In another style of cabinet there is no bar in the center, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;1, but there is observed on one of the sides in the interior a bracket
a few centimeters in length, and back and above this a shelf. This
arrangement permits of performing a few experiments more than does
the one just described. Thus, when the woman has disappeared the
showman allows a young man to enter, and he also disappears, while
the young woman is found in his place. This is a very surprising substitution.</p>

<p>The box into which the harlequin takes refuge, and which appears to
be empty when Pierrot or Cassandra lifts the curtain that shields its
entrance, is also a sort of magic cabinet.</p>

<p>In a series of lectures delivered a few years ago at the London Polytechnic
Institution, a professor of physics unmasked the secret of some
of the tricks employed on the stage for producing illusions, and notably
that of the magic cabinet. The lecturer, after showing the cabinet and
causing the disappearance therein of an individual while the doors were
closed, repeated the same experiment with the latter open. But in the
latter case so quick was the disappearance that the spectators could not
even then see how it was done.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="270" height="174" alt="" />
<p class="tac"><span class="smcap lowercase">FIG. 2.&mdash;PLAN EXPLANATORY OF THE CABINET.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The illusion produced by these apparatus is the result of a play of
mirrors.</p>

<p>In the first cabinet described (Fig.&nbsp;1), when the exhibitor has closed
the doors upon the young woman, the latter pulls toward her two
mirrors that are represented in Fig.&nbsp;2 by the lines G G. These mirrors
are hinged at O O, and when swung outward rest by their external edges
against the bar P, and then occupy the position shown by the dotted
lines G′ G′. When the cabinet is again opened the woman, placed at A,
is hidden by the two mirrors; but the appearance of the interior of the
cabinet is not changed, since the spectators see the image of each side
reflected from the corresponding mirror, and this looks to them like the
back of the cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span></p>

<p>The illusion is perfect. When the experiment is ended and the
mirrors are again swung against the sides, at G G, the spectators see
nothing but the backs of them, which are covered with wood; the cabinet
is really empty, and no one can discover what modification has
taken place in its interior during the disappearance of the woman.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="105" height="216" alt="" />
<p class="tac"><span class="smcap lowercase">FIG. 3.&mdash;SECTION EXPLANATORY OF THE CABINET.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In the second arrangement, which is shown in vertical section in
Fig.&nbsp;3, the young man gets up onto the shelf <i>c n</i>, at the upper part of
the cabinet, by the aid of the bracket T, and then pulls down over him
the mirror <i>b c</i>, which was fastened to the top of the cabinet. This
mirror being inclined at an angle of 45 deg. reflects the top, and the
spectators imagine that they see the back of the cabinet over the shelf
just as they did before.</p>

<p>The box which the harlequin enters is based upon precisely the same
principle. Its interior is hung with paper banded alternately blue and
white. When the harlequin enters it he places himself in one of the
angles and pulls toward him two mirrors which hide him completely,
and which reflect the opposite side of the box, so that the spectator is
led to believe that he sees the back of it. In this case one of the angles
at the back of the box is not apparent, but the colored stripes prevent
the spectator from noticing the fact.</p>

<h4>The Magic Portfolio.</h4>

<p>This is an apparatus which an itinerant physicist might have been
seen a few years ago exhibiting in the squares and at street corners.
His method was to have a spectator draw a card, which he then placed
between the four sheets of paper which, folded crosswise, formed the
flaps of his portfolio. When he opened the latter again a few instants
afterward the card had disappeared, or rather had become transformed.
Profiting then by the surprise of his spectators the showman began to
offer them his magic portfolio at the price of five sous for the small size
and ten for the large.</p>

<p>The portfolio was made of two square pieces of cardboard connected<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
by four strings, these latter being fixed in such a way that when the two
pieces of cardboard were open and juxtaposed the external edge of each
of them was connected with the inner edge of the other.</p>

<p>This constituted, after a manner, a double hinge that permitted of
the portfolio being opened from both sides. To one pair of strings
there were glued, back to back, two sheets of paper, which, when
folded over, formed the flaps of the portfolio. It was only necessary,
then, to open the latter in one direction or the other to render it impossible
to open more than one of the two sets of flaps.</p>

<p>This device is one that permits of a large number of tricks being
performed, since every object put under one of the sets of flaps will apparently
disappear or be converted into something else, at the will of
the prestidigitator (Fig.&nbsp;4).</p>

<h4>Magic Envelopes.</h4>

<p>This trick is a simplification of the foregoing. The affair consists of
several sheets of paper of different colors folded over, one upon the
other. A card inclosed within the middle envelope, over which have
been folded all the others, is found to have disappeared when the flaps
are opened again. The secret of the trick is very simple. One of the
inner sheets of paper&mdash;the second one, usually&mdash;is double, and, when
folded, forms two envelopes that are back to back. It is only necessary
then to open one or the other of these latter to cause the appearance or
disappearance or transformation of such objects as have been inclosed
within it. (Fig.&nbsp;4.)</p>

<p class="tac"><span class="smcap lowercase">FIG. 4.&mdash;MAGIC PORTFOLIO, ENVELOPES, AND BOXES.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span></p>

<h4>Magic Boxes.</h4>

<p>Magic boxes are of several styles, according to the size of the objects
that one desires to make disappear.</p>

<p>There is no one who has not seen a magician put one or more pigeons
into the drawer of one of these boxes, and after closing it open it to find
that the birds have disappeared. Such boxes contain, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;4,
two drawers, which, when pulled out, seem to be but one; and it is
only necessary, then, to pull out the inner one or leave it closed in order
to render the inclosed birds visible or invisible.</p>

<p>In order to cause the disappearance of smaller objects trick performers
often employ a jewel box, and, after putting the object (a ring, for
example) into this, they hand it to some person and ask him to hold it,
requesting him at the same time to wrap it up in several sheets of paper.
But this simple motion has permitted the performer to cause the ring to
drop into his hand through a small trap opening beneath the box. Yet,
while he is doing this, the spectators think that they hear the noise
made by the ring striking against the sides of the box. But that is only
a delusion; for the noise that is heard proceeds from a small hammer
which is hidden within the cover under the escutcheon, and which is
rendered immovable when the latter is pressed upon by the performer.
The box can thus be shaken without any noise being heard within it,
and the spectators are led to believe that the object has disappeared.</p>

<p>Double-bottomed boxes are so well known that it is useless to describe
them. Sometimes the double bottom is hidden in the cover, and
at others it rests against one of the sides. Such boxes permit of the
disappearance or substitution of objects that are not very thick, such as
a note, an image, or a card.&mdash;<i>La Nature.</i></p>


<h3>The Swinging Half Lady.</h3>

<p>An arrangement is made similar to a hammock, which is attached
to the back of the cabinet, and is then affixed to a false wooden bust
made to fit the bust of the lady. It should be thickly padded where the
part of her body rests upon it, and should be tightly strapped to the
lady across the shoulders and back. The bust is covered with silk,
satin, or any fine dress material, and trimmed to represent a lady’s low-necked
dress bodice with short shoulder sleeves. The remaining portion
of the lady is encased in a dark-colored skirt (black velvet is the
best), and her feet are firmly strapped to a wood rest at the back of the
cabinet, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. The bust is supported upon a swing, in the
front of the cabinet. Four brass chains support a slab of wood about
28 inches long by about 8 or ten inches in width.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/i_105.jpg" width="430" height="433" alt="" />
<p class="tac"><span class="smcap lowercase">FIG.</span> 1.</p>
</div>

<p>Midway up the chains at each side is a cross piece of wood fixed to
the chains by which, when the lady grasps them with her hands, she can
easily lift the bust from the wood slab, allowing a sword to be passed
beneath the bottom of the bust and the top of the wood slab. When the<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
lady is supported upon the swing she cannot swing <i>forward</i>, but can
only swing with a slight <i>sideway</i> motion, because if she attempted to
swing forward the slab of wood would then no longer support the bust,
and the performer would be in danger of breaking her back, as she
would have no other support to sustain her, except the back of the cabinet
to which her feet are strapped.</p>

<p>The slab of wood forming the swing is made in some cases with two
half-round holes, to allow the lady to place her hands through, to show
that she can pass her hands beneath her.</p>

<p>The interior of the cabinet should be of one uniform color, if possible
of a dark blue or dark maroon. It should be about six feet in depth
by about five to seven feet across the front, according to fancy. The
front should have either <i>dark</i> blue, maroon, or green baize curtains, so
made as to draw right across. On each side of the cabinet are affixed
two lamps, as in Fig.&nbsp;1, with large plated reflectors about 10 or 12 inches
in diameter. These should be so fixed that the curtains can be drawn at<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
the back of them; and thus, when lighted, reflect a strong and powerful
light <i>outward</i>, throwing the interior of the cabinet into deep and gloomy
shadow. It must be evident, therefore, to the reader that the four lamps
and reflectors play a very important part in making this illusion perfect,
because in consequence of a strong, bright, and dazzling light being reflected
into the eyes of the spectators it is impossible for them to distinguish
anything inside the cabinet, beyond the bust and head of the
lady.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">
<img src="images/i_106.jpg" width="435" height="397" alt="" />
<p class="tac"><span class="smcap lowercase">FIG.</span> 2.</p>
</div>

<p>The position for the lady performing is one of pain. In the first
place she has to be tightly strapped to the bust, which causes difficulty
in breathing and talking; and, again, the head must be held well back
to make it appear from the front as if the false bust and neck were completely
one and upright.</p>

<p>Many ladies performing this illusion cannot help showing in their
look the pain and suffering they are experiencing even when before their
audiences, thereby spoiling the effect the illusion would have had if
their features had been composed and the face wreathed with smiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span></p>


<h3>The Aerial Suspension.</h3>

<p>This trick has been before the public for many years, but when performed
still causes considerable sensation. The apparatus required is,
first, a kind of iron corset, for which the performer doing this trick
must be properly measured and accurately fitted with it, according to
his or her size and build. This corset is strapped upon the body, and
attached to it is a rod passing down the right side from beneath the arm,
almost to the right knee. Below the arm is a projecting piece so made
as to fit into a socket, and almost in the shape of a crutch; and the rod
passing down the side of the performer is so constructed that when a
person has this apparatus strapped securely upon him or her, and the
projecting piece under the arm is fitted into the socket of the pole, the
body can be raised, and the toes in rising will describe an arc of about
90 deg., assuming the position shown in the figure. To effect this two
poles are required of the same length, one made of wood and the other<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
of iron; the latter being fitted into a socket in the stand, and having
also a socket in the top, in which is fixed the projecting piece under the
arm, and this rod therefore supports the whole weight of the body during
the performance. The two poles are both painted the same color,
and to the audience both appear to be the same.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/i_107.jpg" width="430" height="464" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The performer will have to provide a specially made costume to suit
the working of the apparatus. The young lady (we will imagine that it
is a lady who performs this suspension feat) is brought forward by the
professor, and the two rods are shown, and a stool is placed on the stand
on which the lady steps. The iron rod is now placed in position and
fixed under the right arm, and the wood rod is placed under the left; the
professor, now making a few passes with his hands, apparently sends
the lady performer into a mesmeric sleep, and gently draws the rod from
under the left arm and lays it down. Making a few more passes he
gradually raises the body of the lady into a horizontal position, and she
will appear to be suspended almost in the air. With a little practice
the body can be placed into any position. When the lady has been suspended
long enough, make a few more passes and gently lower the body
until in an upright position, and again place the wood rod under the left
arm and place the stool beneath her feet, and taking a handkerchief
wipe the lady’s face, and she will appear to awaken and will step down
from her exalted position.</p>

<p>An improvement has lately been introduced in the apparatus; the
iron column is hollow, and through the center another rod is worked
from beneath the stage, and in the socket of the iron rod at the top are
placed a number of teeth which catch corresponding teeth in the projecting
piece under the arm, and this being worked from below the stage
will cause the body of the lady to slowly rise into a horizontal position
without being so placed by the professor. This is certainly a very great
improvement in the mode of working, as while the professor simply
makes a few passes with his hands the body gradually rises, apparently
to the audience without any visible means whatever.</p>


<h3>The Ghost Illusion.</h3>

<p>This illusion, which created so much sensation in London and first
known here as “Pepper’s Ghost,” I will endeavor to explain, and make
the working of it as clear as I possibly can to the reader. It is caused
by the figure of a man or woman being reflected upon a sheet of glass,
and the audience looking through this glass, apparently see the figure
upon the stage, but in reality it is not so, being only upon the glass. In
the first place a sheet of plate glass perfectly clear and without a blemish
must be procured, and of such a size that it will show the image or
reflection of the performer who impersonates the ghost. This glass is
fixed at the front of the stage and inclined slightly toward the audience.
In front and below the stage a chamber is made, completely concealed<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
from the eyes of the audience, but having an opening at the upper part,
through which the reflection of the person below is thrown upward upon
the sheet of glass. The reader can understand the position better by
referring to the accompanying cut. The body of the person to be reflected
is against an inclined plane, which is covered with black cloth.
This inclined plane is fixed upon castors, and the person leaning against
it, moving this slightly with his feet, either to the right or left, will
cause it to appear as if the ghost was either walking forward or backward.
Below the stage a person is placed with a powerful lantern, and
the light from it is thrown upon the figure representing the ghost, thus
causing it to be reflected strongly and brightly against the glass fixed
above. The stage must be darkened and dimly lighted, otherwise the
ghost will hardly be visible. In making various motions of the body
the ghost actor must reverse his movements; for example, if he raises
his left arm the figure reflected above will appear to raise its right arm.
The glass, as I stated before, must be without a blemish, and fixed at an
angle of 20 deg., inclining forward toward the audience, and the nearer
the audience are seated to it the larger the glass must be. The size of
the glass depends upon the height of the figure to be reflected
and the size of the stage and the theater or hall in which it is exhibited.
This again will be understood by referring to the figure, in which A represents
the eyes of that part of the audience seated in the lower portion
or body of the hall, while B represents the eyes of those who are seated
in the boxes or gallery, thus showing the angle by which the height of
the glass is determined, as the angles of incidence are always equal to
the angles of reflection; and the same angles of incidence are likewise
equal to the corresponding angles of the reflected figure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/i_109.jpg" width="430" height="266" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This illusion was invented in 1863 by Prof. Pepper, by whom it was
patented, and for a long period it was exhibited at the Polytechnic in<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
London, in various forms and guises, and drew thousands from all
parts to see this wonderful exhibition. Although it cannot now be
classed as a “novelty,” yet it still creates a great sensation whenever and
wherever it is exhibited.</p>

<h3>Proprietary and Elegant Preparations.</h3>

<h4>MEDICATED PADS.</h4>

<p>Medicated pads are quite popular with many who have tried them,
and a multitude of remarkable cures are attributed to their use. We
here present formulas equal to the best, and as they are quite simple to
prepare they can now be tried with but little expense:</p>

<h4>Liver Pad.</h4>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Red Cinchona Bark (powder)</span><span class="amt">4</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Fenugreek Seed (powder)</span><span class="amt">1</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Mandrake Root (powder)</span><span class="amt">1</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Black Root (powder)</span><span class="amt">1</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounce.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Gum Guaiac (powder)</span><span class="amt">3</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounces.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Bayberry Bark (powder)</span><span class="amt">4</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;drachms.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Oil of Eucalyptus</span><span class="amt">4</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;drachms.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Grind the drugs with the powdered guaiac and add the oil. The
above is sufficient for two pads, which should be made into an oblong
or diamond shape, with linen or muslin, and worn over the pit of the
stomach. Liver pads are recommended for all diseases arising from a
disordered liver.</p>

<h4>Kidney Pad.</h4>

<p>Useful in all diseases of the kidneys.</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Digitalis Leaves</span><span class="amt">2</span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;ounces.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Grind the drugs to a moderately fine powder, and mix with the oils
and gums. Make an oblong pad and wear over the kidneys.</p>

<h4>Lung Pad.</h4>

oils and gums. Make an oblong pad and wear well up to the throat.</p>

<h4>Wonder Liniment.</h4>

<p>Mix and dissolve.</p>

<p>As a universal liniment for both internal and external use this is
without an equal for relieving pain. It is used where any liniment is
likely to do good in all aches and pains. Preparations of this nature
when used externally should be applied plentifully and vigorously.
This is the reason why itinerant venders of liniments under various
titles such as Wizard Oil, Pain Killer, Instant Relief, etc., produce
such remarkable cures in public. Their remedies all possess more or
less remedial value, but without brisk and patient rubbing they would
do as little good when applied externally as so much cold water. Now
that a reliable formula is at hand a quantity of this Wonder Liniment
can be prepared at a minimum cost without paying for bottles, labels,
advertising, salaries, rents, etc., which are the necessary expenses of all
medicine firms, and which ultimately are borne by the consumer.</p>

<h4>Liquid Lightning.</h4>

<p>An excellent liniment for external application, which has been sold
under various names, is prepared as follows:</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>Mix, and apply by rubbing with the hand. This is useful in rheumatism,
neuralgia, headache, toothache, and all nervous pains.</p>

<h3>Electric Catarrh Remedy.</h3>

<p>This remedy, under various electrical names, is inclosed in a closely
stoppered bottle or box containing a bit of zinc and copper to which is
attached a piece of cotton or sponge saturated with the preparation,<span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>
which is very volatile and irritating to the mucuous membrane, and
produces by inhalation a decided effect at once. The patient is led to
believe that there is some electrical value attached to the combination,
and, strange to say, in the face of such absurdity it has many votaries;
however, notwithstanding the electrical deception it has merits as an
inhalant, and remarkable cures of catarrh, headache, neuralgia, etc., are
ascribed to its use. The following is the required formula:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The boracic acid, subnitrate of bismuth, thymol, and pimento is
placed in a mortar and reduced to a fine powder. The leaves of the
cassia lanceolata are subjected with the petrolatum to a sufficient degree
of heat to extract the active principles of the leaves, after which
the petrolatum is strained off and added to the powdered substances
before mentioned with the spirit of wintergreen, the whole being thoroughly
commingled and mixed in any convenient manner. In using
the compound it is applied locally in the usual manner by means of the
fingers or any material by which the application can be thoroughly
effected. As an ointment it is especially applicable to the treatment
of catarrh, malignant sores, abrasions, and other affections where a
local remedy can be applied.</p>

<h3>Rubber Patching and Waterproofing.</h3>

<p>Capt. Paul Boyton, the famous aquatic voyager in his rubber suit,
has furnished us two practical suggestions in regard to patching rubber
boots, coats, etc., and also to waterproof sails, tents, awnings, and
similar fabrics.</p>


<h4>To Patch a Rubber Boot or Garment.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/i_131.jpg" width="220" height="224" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Take a piece of sand-paper and roughen the edges of the break as
far around as the size of the patch. Next apply rubber cement to the
roughened surface, and at the same time cement a piece of rubber cloth
or cloth well coated with the cement. Let both remain for four hours in
a place free from dust. Then put on another thin coat of cement and let
them lay for about two hours. Next place the patch carefully over the
break and hammer well together. Let stand for a few hours and the place
will be as strong and tight as ever. Be sure the patch and the article
to be patched are perfectly dry before applying the cement.</p>

<p>Pure natural rubber or rubber cement can be obtained at any rubber
store, also prepared patch cloth.</p>

<h4>To Make Rubber Cement.</h4>

<p>Take half a pound of pure natural rubber, cut it into small pieces,
and dissolve it in a sufficient quantity of 100 proof naptha. It will take
from two to three days to dissolve properly.</p>

<h4>To Waterproof Canvas or Cloth.</h4>

<p>Take one pound of yellow paraffine wax and dissolve in one quart of
benzine. Apply with a brush.</p>


<h3>To Make Tissues Incombustible.</h3>

<p>The Societé d’Encouragement of Paris has recently awarded a prize
of 2,000 francs to J.&nbsp;A. Martin of Paris for the following preparations
for making tissues fire-proof. The conditions under which the award
was offered were as follows: The ingredients constituting the preparations
must be cheap and easily applied, must neither injure the tissues
themselves nor their colors, must be neither of a poisonous nor caustic
nature, must not change in a very moist nor very dry atmosphere, and<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
finally the impregnated tissues and wood must remain incombustible
after they have been exposed for one month to a temperature of 100° to
120°&nbsp;Fahr. It was found that Martin’s fluids made the tissues and the
surface of wood incombustible, that they do not attack the tissues and
their colors, and that they remained incombustible after having been
exposed for several months in a drying chamber to a temperature of 97°
Fahr. The experiments were made by the Society and at the same time
in the different Paris theaters.</p>

<h4>For all Light Tissues.</h4>

<div class="center">
<table class="ml22" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tar"><div class="dots"><span class="item">Ammonium Sulphate</span><span class="amt">8 </span></div></td><td class="tal">&nbsp;parts.</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Two-fifths part of dextrine (or the same quantity of gelatine) may be
substituted for the 2 parts of starch. The fluid is heated to 85° Fahr.
and the tissues immersed in it until they are thoroughly permeated.
They are then slightly wrung and dried sufficiently for ironing. The
quantity of the starch or dextrine or gelatine may be changed according
as the tissues are to be more or less stiff.</p>

<h4>For Painted Decorations and Wood.</h4>

<p>Add sufficient powdered talc to give the mass the necessary consistency.
For use it is heated to 120° or 140° Fahr. and applied with a brush.
For decorations already painted it suffices to apply it to the back and
wooden frames.</p>

<p>The fluid is heated to 220° Fahr. and the articles are submerged in it
for 15 to 20 minutes, wrung out slightly, and dried.&mdash;<i>Techno-Chemical

<h3>Gold and Silver Inks.</h3>

<p>Take equal parts of gold leaf (or silver leaf) and honey. Triturate
them in a mortar until perfectly fine, add about 30 parts hot water, and
triturate. Allow to settle and pour off the water. Triturate again with
fresh hot water. Allow to settle and pour off as before. Repeat the
washing several times until the honey is all washed out, then dry the
powdered gold leaf and mix it with water and gum arabic. It must be
shaken occasionally while writing. Very fine bronze may be made into
ink by adding water and gum arabic and shaking occasionally while
writing. (For other inks see page <a href="#Page_20">20</a>.)</p>

<h3>Worcestershire Sauce.</h3>

<p>The composition of this sauce is a trade secret, but a variety of similar
sauces are found on the market. A good imitation may be made as
follows:</p>

<p>Chop the green outer covering of unripe walnuts 5 pounds, bruise
them to a pulp in a mortar, pour upon them 6 pints of good strong vinegar,
and after standing a day heat to boiling and strain with strong
pressure. To the liquid thus obtained add garlic, grated to a pulp, 2
ounces; capsicum, in fine powder, 2 ounces; black pepper, 1 ounce; cinnamon,
<span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> ounces; nutmeg, <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> ounce; allspice, 1 ounce; cloves, <span class="nowrap"> <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> ounce,
all in fine powder; salt, 12 ounces; brown sugar, 8 ounces, and enough
good vinegar to make 1 gallon of the finished product. This is to stand
for some time, with frequent agitation, and then be put up in bottles.</p>


<h3>Butter Color.</h3>

<p>Annatto, fresh and of good quality, 2 pounds; salad oil of good quality
without flavor (purified cotton-seed oil is best), sufficient to make 1
gallon. Rub the annatto with a portion, about one-third, of the oil and
macerate it by the heat of a water-bath for 12 hours, stirring occasionally,
pour off the liquid and add to the residue another portion, about
one-third of the oil, and macerate as before, adding the product of the
portion before reserved, then add the remainder of the oil to the sediment,
macerate as before and add the product to the reserved portions
to make 1 gallon of butter color.&mdash;<i>Fenner’s Formulary.</i></p>
